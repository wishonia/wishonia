# Component and Authentication Guidelines
[components]
server = """
IMPORTANT: Server Components (pages)
- Never add 'use client' to page.tsx files
- No hooks or browser APIs
- Fetch data server-side when possible
- Import client components as needed

Auth Usage:
import { requireAuth } from "@/lib/auth"
const session = await requireAuth(`/my-page`)
"""

client = """
When to use client components:
- Uses hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- Needs browser APIs
- Has user interactions
- Uses client-side libraries

Location: app/my-feature/components/InteractiveComponent.tsx

Auth Usage:
import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react'
const { data: session } = useSession()
"""

# Next.js App Router conventions
[next]
routing = """
- Use app directory for all routes
- page.tsx files are automatically server components
- loading.tsx for loading states
- error.tsx for error handling
- layout.tsx for shared layouts
"""

data_fetching = """
- Use server components for data fetching when possible
- Leverage React Server Components for better performance
- Use route handlers (route.ts) for API endpoints
"""

# Type Safety and Database
[code_quality]
types = """
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Import Prisma types directly from @prisma/client
- Create interfaces for component props
- Avoid 'any' type
- Always prefer schema.prisma types over creating new ones

Example:
import { Post, User } from '@prisma/client'
"""

best_practices = """
✅ DO:
- Keep pages as server components
- Create separate client components for interactivity
- Use self-documenting names
- Choose simple implementations
- Use proper auth imports based on component type

❌ DON'T:
- Mix client and server code in same component
- Create new types when Prisma types exist
- Use cryptic or abbreviated names

# Performance guidelines

- Keep pages as server components when possible
