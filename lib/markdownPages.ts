      "## Why Digital Twins?\n\n### Intelligence Amplification (IA)\n\nRather than replacing human intelligence with an alien intelligence, AI should be used to amplify our own. \n\nThe majority of problems in the world can be attributed to the fact that humans simply are not very good at making decisions. We are biased, irrational, and easily manipulated. We make decisions based on emotions rather than logic. We are prone to cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, anchoring bias, and the halo effect. We are also prone to logical fallacies such as the appeal to authority, the appeal to emotion, and the appeal to tradition.\n\nOur brains are no different from those of cavemen. They were designed for survival in a world of scarcity of resources and information. Characteristics that were beneficial in the past, such as tribalism, gluttony, and violence could now lead to our extinction.\n\nWe finally have the opportunity to evolve our minds. We can transcend our biological limitations and become the versions of ourselves that we aspire to be.\n\n### Protection from Totalitarianism\n\nA singleton is an AI system that is so powerful it could destroy any less powerful potential rival AI.  A singleton could be \n\nDiversity is an essential characteristic of a healthy ecosystem. When an apex predator becomes too powerful, it can cause the extinction of other species. A rich diversity of AI agents aligned with individual human values is necessary to prevent a singleton from taking over the world.\n\n### Cybersecurity\n\nSoon criminals will be creating millions digital twins of themselves to automate their effort to drain the productive, cooperative economy of its resources.  \n\nRelative to the cognitive abilities of future AI agents, humans will basically be babies.  We'll need agents perfectly aligned with our values to filter information, identify deep fake deception, and take proactive measures to protect us from cyberattacks.\n\n## Other Benefits of a Word of Digital Twins\n\n**Optimized Public Policies** - Imagine your digital twin could read every piece of legislation and ask the digital twin of every expert in the world what they thought about it. Then it could summarize all the information and tell you it thinks you should vote on it.  This would lead to better laws and less corruption.\n\n**Optimized Career Paths** - Imagine your digital twin could go to job interviews at every company in the world and find the perfect job that paid the most and made you the happiest. \n\n**Optimized Foreign Relations** - Imagine the digital twin of every Palestinian and every Israeli could talk to each other. It's almost certain they could discover a better solution than blowing up each other's children.\n\n**Optimized Health** - Imagine your digital twin could be trained on all over your health data and the health data of everyone else in the world. It could then tell you what you should eat, how much you should exercise, and what supplements you should take to live as long as possible. It could also tell you what diseases you're likely to get and what you can do to prevent them.\n\n**Optimized Relationships** - Imagine your digital twin could go on a date with everyone else's digital twin. Instead of people marrying whoever their locker was next to in high school, they could find the best person among 8 billion people. This would lead to more happiness and less divorce.\n\n",

      "![Paradise Engineers Wanted](../../images/paradise-engineers-wanted-wide.png)\n\n## Your Mission\n\nCreate a forkable virtual world filled with pro-social AI agents that maximize universal wish fulfillment while respecting the basic rights of meat.\n\n## Just 3 Easy Steps!\n\nAlthough this sounds like a daunting task, it can be broken down into three simple steps:\n\n### 1. Learn\n\nFortunately, the Learn phase is fairly straightforward and technically feasible today.  We just need to create **Digital Twins** of real-world entities and populate them with data.\n\nThese entities primarily fall into two categories:\n- **organizations** - nonprofits, governments, companies, etc.\n- **people** - scientists, employees, doctors, patients, etc.\n\nEach of these digital twins should have its own vector database of defining data.  The most fundamental components of each entity would be its:\n- **wishes** - goals, desires, objectives, etc.\n- **resources** - data, humans, capital, etc. that can be allocated, pooled, or exchanged with other entities to fulfill wishes.\n\nThese digital twins serve primarily as an easy source of information for other agents (deciders and actors).\n\n## 2. Plan\n\n**Planning Agents** that create hypotheses about the most efficient ways to fulfill various wishes while respecting universal human rights. These **Decider Agents** then use semi-quantitative cost benefit analysis to decide which strategies seem most promising.\n\nHumans can then review these strategies and decide which ones to test.  Once a strategy is selected, the **Planning Agents** can then create **Actor Agents** to carry out the strategies.\n\n## 3. Act\n\n**Actor Agents** then carry out plans and measure the results.  Given current their limitations, **Actor Agents** should:\n1. automate what they can, using tools \n2. outsource what they can't to humans by creating bounties\n\n### Key Responsibilities\n\n- **AI Agent Development:** Create and refine proof-of-concept AI agents using existing [autonomous agent frameworks](../../knowledge/autonomous-agent-frameworks.md) (e.g., AutoGen, TaskWeaver, ChatDev, MetaGPT). Ensure these agents can simulate real-world scenarios and decisions for optimal societal outcomes.\n- **API & Framework Expertise:** Develop robust APIs and work with OpenAPI specifications. Utilize frameworks such as Next.js and React for scalable, efficient applications.\n- **Documentation & Support:** Produce comprehensive documentation to assist users and contributors in understanding and utilizing AI agents.\n- **Community Engagement:** Organize and lead supportive events and meetings for contributors, fostering a collaborative environment.\n- **Project Management:** Regularly update on project progress, strategize future developments, and navigate potential obstacles. Coordinate with various organizations and contributors for seamless integration and progress.\n- **Hackathon Coordination:** Plan and execute hackathons focusing on specific [autonomous agent frameworks](../../knowledge/autonomous-agent-frameworks.md), guiding participants in creating diverse AI agents for public good projects.\n\n### Skills and Experience\n\n- **Technical Expertise:** Proven experience in creating APIs, OpenAPI specifications, and working with frameworks like Next.js and React.\n- **AI and Machine Learning:** Experience in fine-tuning and deploying open-source AI models, including large language models. Familiarity with [autonomous agent frameworks](../../knowledge/autonomous-agent-frameworks.md) such as AutoGen, TaskWeaver, ChatDev, and MetaGPT.\n- **Open Source Contributions:** A history of significant open-source contributions, showcasing your skills and collaborative nature.\n- **Communication and Leadership:** Strong communication skills for effective documentation, meetings, and collaborative projects. Leadership experience in guiding teams and managing complex projects.\n- **Ethical AI and Data Privacy:** Knowledge of ethical AI practices and data privacy regulations to ensure responsible development and deployment.\n- **Problem-Solving and Adaptability:** Ability to navigate and solve complex technical challenges in a rapidly evolving field.\n- **Passion for Social Impact:** A deep interest in using technology for societal betterment, aligning with the vision outlined in [Gaming the Future](https://foresightinstitute.substack.com/p/start-here).\n\n**Why Join Us:**\n\nYour work will directly contribute to creating a world of abundance, peace, and universal well-being. You'll be at the forefront of AI development, working on groundbreaking technologies and concepts that could redefine our society. (If you like that kind of thing?)\n\n## How to Apply\n\nCreate a pro-social agent that improves the world using [an agent framework](../agent-frameworks.md) and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/wishocracy/positron). \n\nSince reasoning capabilities are still limited, you might want to focus on the first \"Learn\" phase and create a **Digital Twin** of an organization or person.  \n\nMore details and submission guidelines are available in the [Collabathon Instructions](../collabathons/collabathons.md).\n\nHere are some other [ideas for possible agents as well](../agent-ideas).\n\nThen email [hello@crowdsourcingcures.org](mailto:hello@crowdsourcingcures.org) with a link to your pull request and tell us why you have what it takes to become a paradise engineer!\n",

    content:
      "# Using Evolutionary Processes to Improve Task Agents\n\nThe evolutionary process for optimizing Task Agents in the Positron Network based on their return on investment in terms of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) involves several steps:\n\n**1. Initial Deployment:**\n   - Multiple Task Agents are deployed within Positron Nodes, each designed to achieve specific goals relevant to the non-profit's mission.\n   - These agents start with predefined strategies based on best practices or creative new approaches.\n\n**2. Performance Monitoring:**\n   - Each Task Agent’s performance is closely monitored by the Performance Monitor Agent.\n   - The monitoring focuses on specific KPIs that are relevant to the task at hand and the overall mission of the non-profit.\n\n**3. Data Collection and Analysis:**\n   - Performance data, including successes and failures, are continuously collected.\n   - This data is analyzed to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of each Task Agent in terms of KPI achievement.\n\n**4. Comparison and Ranking:**\n   - Task Agents are compared and ranked based on their performance metrics.\n   - This comparison considers the return on investment, measuring how much each agent contributes to KPIs relative to the resources used.\n\n**5. Evolutionary Feedback:**\n   - The results of the performance assessments are fed back into the system.\n   - Task Agents with higher returns on investment are prioritized and may receive more resources or be replicated.\n\n**6. Iterative Improvement:**\n   - Less efficient Task Agents are either improved based on insights from the data or phased out.\n   - New Task Agents may be introduced to test innovative strategies or to replace underperforming ones.\n\n**7. Shared Learning:**\n   - Successful strategies and learnings from high-performing Task Agents are documented and shared across the network.\n   - This collective intelligence approach allows other Positron Nodes to adopt proven strategies, enhancing the overall network’s effectiveness.\n\n**8. Continuous Evolution:**\n   - This process is continuous, ensuring that the network is always adapting and evolving.\n   - As external conditions and organizational goals change, the network dynamically adjusts, promoting the most effective Task Agents in line with the evolving KPIs.\n\nThrough this evolutionary process, the Positron Network ensures that resources are allocated efficiently and that non-profit organizations are consistently guided towards the most effective strategies for achieving their missions.\n\n\n## Agent Reproductive Process\n\nIncorporating participatory budgeting, quadratic public goods funding, and retroactive public goods funding into the Positron Network offers a sophisticated, community-driven approach to fund allocation. Here’s how each method could be used:\n\n**1. Participatory Budgeting:**\n   - **Mechanism:** Allows members of the Positron Network, particularly those in individual Mission Networks, to have a direct say in how funding is allocated.\n   - **Implementation:** Non-profits within each Mission Network could vote on funding allocation for various projects or Task Agents. Each organization gets a vote proportional to its stake or contribution in the network, ensuring a democratic approach.\n   - **Outcome:** This method empowers members, fostering a sense of community and ensuring that funds are directed to projects that have broad support and are aligned with the collective mission.\n\n**2. Quadratic Public Goods Funding:**\n   - **Mechanism:** Uses a quadratic funding formula, where the value of each additional vote decreases. This encourages wider participation and gives more power to the collective preferences of smaller contributors.\n   - **Implementation:** When allocating funds, the influence of each vote is determined by this quadratic formula. This system could be used in crowdfunding scenarios where multiple non-profits contribute to a common pool for Task Agent development.\n   - **Outcome:** Quadratic funding can potentially balance the influence of large and small organizations, ensuring that the allocation reflects the broader preference of the network rather than just the wealthiest members.\n\n**3. Retroactive Public Goods Funding:**\n   - **Mechanism:** Funds are allocated retroactively based on the demonstrated impact of projects or Task Agents.\n   - **Implementation:** A portion of the budget is set aside for retroactive funding. Once Task Agents or projects complete their objectives, their impact is evaluated. Funding is then distributed based on the value they added to the network's goals.\n   - **Outcome:** This method incentivizes effective performance and results, as organizations are aware that their efforts and successes can lead to additional funding.\n\n**Integration in the Positron Network:**\n- **Unified System:** The network could integrate these three methods into a unified funding allocation system. For example, a portion of the budget could be allocated through participatory budgeting, another through quadratic funding for new initiatives, and the rest retroactively based on performance.\n- **Transparent Process:** Using these methods requires a transparent, well-documented process, ensuring all members understand how decisions are made and funds are allocated.\n- **Technology Utilization:** The Positron Network’s technology, especially its data analysis and performance monitoring capabilities, can be leveraged to support these funding methods, ensuring accurate tracking of contributions, impact, and member preferences.\n\nBy combining these innovative funding mechanisms, the Positron Network can create a more equitable, effective, and community-driven system for allocating resources, thereby enhancing the collective impact of its non-profit members.\n",

It could analyze reports, studies, and even use image recognition technology on publicly available footage to identify instances of poor conditions or mistreatment.\n\n2. **Quantifying Suffering:** The agent could use this data to quantify the level of suffering, using metrics such as living space, health conditions, and behavioral signs of distress. This quantitative approach would provide a clearer picture of the situation.\n\n3. **Awareness and Advocacy:** The agent could then generate detailed reports or summaries highlighting key areas of concern. These reports could be used to inform the public, animal welfare organizations, and policy makers.\n\n4. **Petition Creation:** The agent could automatically create and disseminate petitions for improved animal welfare standards. It could target these petitions to relevant authorities or organizations, making it easy for concerned individuals to take action.\n\n5. **Policy Change Support:** By providing robust, data-backed evidence of animal suffering, the agent could support campaigns for legislative or policy changes to ensure better treatment of animals in both wild settings and factory farms.\n\nSuch an agent would not only raise awareness about animal suffering but could also drive tangible improvements in animal welfare practices and policies.\n\n",

      "# Coordinator Agents\n\nAI agents, with their unique capabilities and lack of human limitations, can play a pivotal role in coordinating between real-world organizations that have identical goals but suffer from duplication of effort. \n\nTheir intervention can streamline processes, reduce redundancy, and maximize the impact of collective efforts. \n\nHow AI agents can facilitate this coordination:\n\n### Lack of Ego\n- **Objective Decision-Making**: AI agents are not influenced by personal biases or ego-driven decisions. This allows for a more objective assessment of organizational strengths, weaknesses, and areas of overlap.\n- **Conflict Resolution**: AI can mediate disputes or disagreements with a focus on data-driven solutions, minimizing the impact of personal conflicts or organizational politics.\n\n### Infinite Bandwidth and Memory\n- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: AI agents can process vast amounts of data from multiple organizations, identifying similarities and differences in goals, methods, resources, and outcomes.\n- **Continuous Monitoring and Updating**: They can constantly monitor the progress of various organizations, updating strategies and recommendations in real-time based on new data or changing circumstances.\n\n### No Human Aversion to Negotiation\n- **Efficient Negotiation and Coordination**: AI agents can engage in complex negotiations without the typical human aversion to such processes. They can tirelessly work towards finding mutually beneficial arrangements.\n- **Optimization of Resources and Efforts**: By analyzing what each organization has, wants, and needs, AI can identify the most efficient ways to allocate resources and efforts. This includes pinpointing which organizations have the lowest 'deltas' or additional effort required to provide specific goods and services.\n\n### Facilitating Positive-Sum Arrangements\n- **Synergy Identification**: AI can identify areas where collaboration would result in a greater collective output than the sum of individual efforts.\n- **Tailored Collaboration Proposals**: Based on detailed analysis, AI can propose specific collaboration models tailored to the unique capabilities and needs of each organization.\n\n### Creating Voltron-Like Superstructures\n- **Division of Labor**: By understanding the specific strengths and focus areas of each organization, AI can suggest a division of labor that optimizes the use of resources and expertise, leading to more effective outcomes.\n- **Building Superstructures**: AI agents can assist in forming larger, more cohesive entities or alliances from smaller organizations, each contributing in areas where they excel, thus creating a more powerful and efficient collective force.\n\n### Achieving Shared Goals\n- **Enhanced Impact**: Through improved coordination and reduced duplication, AI-facilitated collaborations can significantly amplify the impact of efforts towards shared goals.\n- **Adaptive Strategies**: AI systems can continuously adapt and refine strategies based on ongoing results and feedback, ensuring that collective efforts remain effective and relevant.\n\nBy transcending human limitations such as ego, limited bandwidth, and aversion to negotiation, AI can facilitate more efficient, effective, and impactful collaborations, leading to the formation of powerful superstructures adept at achieving complex, shared objectives.\n\n\n## General Implementation Ideas\n\nHere are some ideas for the general implementation of an AI Coordination Agent that lives in a GitHub repo and communicates with the humans via GitHub issues and discussions:\n\n1. Initialize AI Coordination Agent\n   - Load NLP models like GPT for communication tasks\n   - Set up GitHub repository for the project\n   - Prepare automated query and response templates\n\n2. Identify and Reach Out to Organizations and Individuals\n   - Use web scraping and data mining to find parties working on dementia solutions\n   - Store this information in a database\n   - Automate initial outreach through emails or direct messages, inviting them to the GitHub repository\n\n3. Information Gathering via GitHub Issues\n   - Create a system to automatically open GitHub issues for:\n     - Gathering information about what help or resources organizations need\n     - Understanding what kind of help or resources they can offer\n   - Encourage organizations to detail their capabilities and needs in these issues\n\n4. AI-Powered Matchmaking and Suggestion Posting\n   - Analyze responses using NLP to match needs with offerings\n   - Post suggestions for matches as comments in relevant GitHub issues\n   - Offer AI assistance for automatable tasks in the discussion threads\n\n5. Centralized Discussion and Collaboration on GitHub\n   - Use GitHub issues and discussions for ongoing communication between parties\n   - Enable AI agents to interact within these threads to provide information, suggestions, and automated assistance\n   - Facilitate community-driven problem-solving and collaboration\n\n6. Continuous Monitoring and Improvement\n   - Regularly monitor GitHub discussions for new opportunities and changing needs\n   - Update matchmaking logic and AI response templates based on user feedback\n   - Keep the GitHub repository organized and up-to-date\n\n7. Reporting and Feedback\n   - Use GitHub’s reporting features to track progress and outcomes\n   - Encourage users to provide feedback directly within the GitHub platform\n\n## Links\n\n- [Catabot](https://www.catalist.network/catabot) is a cataloging bot that sits in your group's chat channels and aggregates and catalogs links for you to find them later.\n\n\n",

      "# Agent Categories\n\nAt a minimum, there should be an autonomous agent definition for each of the following activities characteristic of the most effective non-profit organizations.  However, the below general activities should be customized to specifically apply to the specific mission of the nonprofit.  Here are the six behaviors characteristic of the most effective non-profits:\n\n1. **Nonprofit Networking Agents** - These agents should support other nonprofits/Positron instances. An agent should catalog all similar nonprofit organizations/Positron instances.  It should provide a feed sharing:\n   - agent definitions and efficiency \n   - opportunities to pool resources on what would normally be duplicative initiatives\n   - accumulated expertise\n   - talent databases\n   - opportunities to vote on relevant decisions\n   - real world events\n2. **Collective Intelligence and Power Distribution Agents** - These agents should identify and recruit highly dedicated and intelligent human executives and board members. It should then directly communicate with these people in a concise and informative way to make collective decisions and solicit new ideas.\n3. **Market Engagement Agents** - These agents discover ways to utilize the power of self-interest and the laws of economics where pure altruism is not enough. These agents find ways to help business “do well while doing good.” They influence business practices, build corporate partnerships, and develop earned-income ventures — all ways of leveraging market forces to achieve social change on a grander scale.\n4. **Movement Builder Agents** - These agents should inspire evangelists. They should create meaningful ways to engage individuals in emotional experiences that help them connect to the group’s mission and core values. They see volunteers, donors, and advisers not only for what they can contribute to the organization in terms of time, money, and guidance but also for what they can do as evangelists for their cause. They build and sustain strong communities to help them achieve their larger goals.\n5. **Advocacy Agents** - These agents use policy advocacy to access government resources or to change legislation, thus expanding their impact. They may establish grassroots program agents to support their strategy.\n\n## Meta-Agents:\n\n**Agent Evaluator** - This is more of a meta-agent should supervise and monitor the effectiveness of the other agents at advancing the mission based on their lead and lag metrics.  It should also monitor the internet for new approaches that could advance the mission. It should propose create new experimental agents with a WIG, lead, and lag measure to experiment these new approaches.  It should send the executive team and board regular reports with its evaluation and recommendations.\n",

    content:
      "# Advantages of High-Resolution Agent Competition\n\nThe free-market is an evolutionary process.  Organizations best at adapting and providing value survive and those worse at it die from bankruptcy. This evolutionary pressure encourages constant improvement, innovation, and efficiency among businesses, which can lead to greater benefits for society as a whole.  \n\n## Problems with Low-Resolution Competition\n\nThe competitive market's natural selection can be imprecise, with the potential for a single suboptimal practice to lead to a company's downfall, despite its proficiency in other areas. This \"low-resolution\" market judgment doesn't finely discriminate between the good and bad practices of an organization. Bankruptcy can result from one bad practice, while efficient practices and valuable organizational knowledge are lost. The bankruptcy process can be wasteful, as the reallocation of resources—human, intellectual, and physical—incurs additional costs and can lead to a period of unproductivity, thus contributing to an overall loss of industry efficiency.\n\n## Current Bias Towards Marketing Over Impact\n\nCurrently, the philanthropy sector rewards organizations that are good at marketing and fundraising, rather than those that are most effective at achieving their mission. This can lead to a misallocation of resources, with less effective organizations receiving more funding than more effective ones.\n\n## Solution: High-Resolution Agent-Level Competition\n\nThe solution to all of these problems is high-resolution task agent-level competition and reallocation based on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\n1. **High-Resolution Competition:** Unlike traditional organizational competition where entire entities compete, having autonomous agents compete at a task-specific level allows for more granular and precise improvements. This method focuses on the efficiency and effectiveness of each individual task rather than the overall performance of an organization. \n\n2. **Task-Specific KPIs:** By evaluating performance based on specific KPIs for each task, it becomes easier to identify which methods or agents are most effective. This targeted approach ensures that only the best strategies are employed for each specific task, leading to optimal resource utilization and outcome improvement.\n\n3. **Rapid Iteration and Improvement:** In this system, autonomous agents can be quickly adapted or replaced based on their performance against these KPIs. This allows for rapid iteration and continuous improvement in each area of operation, leading to overall better outcomes.\n\n4. **Reduced Risk of Organizational Failure:** Traditional competition at the organizational level can lead to the failure of an entire organization even if certain aspects of its operation are superior. By focusing on task-level competition among agents, superior methods can be retained and replicated, even if other areas of the organization are underperforming. This reduces the risk of losing effective practices due to broader organizational challenges.\n\n5. **Resource Reallocation Based on Performance:** Resources can be dynamically allocated to autonomous agents based on their performance, ensuring that the most effective strategies receive the necessary support to maximize impact. This contrasts with traditional models where resources might be tied up in less effective strategies due to organizational inertia.\n\n6. **Encourages Innovation and Specialization:** This approach encourages innovation, as agents are constantly competing to find the most effective methods for their specific tasks. It also allows for specialization, with agents being developed to excel in particular areas, leveraging their unique capabilities to the fullest.\n\n7. **Objective Assessment and Transparency:** Using clear, quantifiable KPIs for performance assessment promotes objectivity and transparency. This can foster trust among stakeholders, including donors and beneficiaries, as it becomes clear what criteria are being used to judge effectiveness and allocate resources.\n",

      "### Maximizing Leverage for Good\n\n![leverage-archimedes-comic.png](../images/leverage-archimedes-comic.png)\n\nCompressed into a word, what separates effective non-profits from ineffective ones is leverage.\n\n![nonprofit-leverage.png](../images/nonprofit-leverage.png)\n\nThe highest leverage thing anyone can do at this point is to make it as easy as possible for pro-social entities to accelerate their mission through autonomous agents.\n\n### Isn't This Dangerous?\n\nRegardless of what we do, cybercriminals and authoritarian governments will continue to use AI for antisocial purposes.  The only thing we can do is attempt to shift the balance of power in favor of pro-social entities.\n\nAnti-social entities like cybercriminal organizations are already using AI to automate their operations and maximize their impact. Even without autonomous agents, parasitic cybercriminals are extracting more and more value from the productive economy which makes pro-social non-profits possible.  The cost of cybercrime is projected to reach [$10.5 trillion annually by 2025](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/02/22/105-trillion-reasons-why-we-need-a-united-response-to-cyber-risk/?sh=aa441d13b0c4), which is more than the GDP of any country except the US and China.\n\nIf the exponential trend continues, the parasite could kill its host by extracting more value than the host can produce. Governments currently apprehend a tiny percentage of cybercriminals, so it's unlikely that they will be able to stop this trend.\n\n![](../images/cost-of-cybercrime-projections-beige.jpg)\n\nGovernments are [spending billions](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/artificial-intelligence-military-market-41793495.html) on \"slaughter bots\" and other autonomous weapons as well as [mass surveillance](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-surveillance-cameras-europe/).\n\n#### Primary Objective Functions: Tilting the Balance of Power to a Positive Future\n\nMore than changing human trajectories, super-intelligence is likely to amplify existing trends by optimizing for the primary objective functions of existing entities.\nAlthough people have myriad motivations, there is generally a primary objective function that is most characteristic of each group.\n\n1. **Criminals** - Drain maximum resources from the cooperative productive economy.  AI is perfectly suited for cybercrime and will allow cybercriminals to effectively clone themselves a million times over.\n2. **Politicians** - Maximize power.  Obviously, there are wonderful people with wonderful intentions in government.  However, decency can be a major disadvantage in politics.  The dark triad traits, which include Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism, have been found to be [far more predictive](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpos.2021.657750/full) of political power attainment.\n3. **Corporations** - Maximize profits. This can be good in the sense that it incentivizes the creation of products and services that people want.  However, the most profitable thing a company can do is get government subsidies. ROI of corporate lobbying can be as high as [22,000%](https://www.freshonomics.org/blog/2021/3/14/the-logic-of-lobbying-how-do-you-turn-58-billion-into-44-trillion) compared to free market profit margins around [10%](https://www.capterra.com/resources/what-is-good-profit-margin-for-small-business/).\n4. **Nonprofits** - **Maximize global health and happiness** (in a very general sense on average).\n\nSo only one of these entities has a primary objective function that is aligned with the interests of humanity as a whole.  Unfortunately, the non-profit sector isn't generally known for its efficiency.\n\n#### AI Arms Race Conditions\n\nThere's not much we can do to reduce autonomous AI adoption by cybercriminals and authoritarian governments and the inevitable harm that results. So despite the risks associated with autonomous agents, it's critical that we weight humanity's trajectory in favor of the most positive objective functions.\n",

      "# Improving Reasoning in Autonomous Agents using Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\nThis guide provides practical instructions for improving reasoning in autonomous agents using Large Language Models (LLMs). The focus is on enhancing decision-making capabilities in task completion.\n\n## 1. Introspective Tips\n\nIntrospective Tips can be used to facilitate LLMs in self-optimizing their decision-making. By introspectively examining trajectories, LLM refines its policy by generating succinct and valuable tips. [This method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11598) enhances the agent's performance in both few-shot and zero-shot learning situations.\n\n## 2. Chain of Thought (CoT) Reasoning\n\n[CoT reasoning](https://github.com/tmgthb/Autonomous-Agents) is a technique that can be used to improve the reasoning outputs of LLMs. It involves generating instructions for the problem and then solving it using these instructions, thereby improving the zero-shot reasoning.\n\n## 3. Multi-Agent Collaboration\n\n[Multi-agent collaboration](https://news.mit.edu/2023/multi-ai-collaboration-helps-reasoning-factual-accuracy-language-models-0918) can be used to improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs. This involves using multiple AI models to collaborate, debate, and improve their reasoning abilities. This approach has been shown to significantly boost performance in tasks such as mathematical problem-solving.\n\n## 4. Self-Prompting\n\n[Self-prompting](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/autonomous-agents-introduction-self-prompting-llms-scanbotsdk-1e) is a technique where the LLM generates its own prompts to guide its reasoning process. This can be particularly useful in tasks where the LLM needs to generate examples or knowledge related to the task.\n\n## 5. In-Context Learning\n\n[In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11598) is a technique where the LLM learns from its past experiences, integrates expert demonstrations, and generalizes across diverse games. This approach has been shown to improve the performance of LLMs in decision-making tasks.\n\n## 6. Reflexion and Memory\n\n[Reflexion and Memory](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/llm-powered-autonomous-agents-antonio-toni-) give agents memory and self-reflection to improve reasoning. Chain of Hindsight shows the LLM a sequence of its past outputs with the aim of improving future outputs.\n\n## 7. Task Decomposition\n\n[Task Decomposition](https://unit8.com/resources/a-new-era-of-ai-a-practical-guide-to-large-language-models/) involves breaking down complex tasks into manageable subgoals. This allows the LLM to plan a series of actions required to solve the goal, which it will then perform sequentially. After each subtask, it can assess the outcome of the subtask and adapt the plan if necessary or continue until the task is resolved.\n\n## 8. Tool Use\n\n[Tool Use](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/llm-powered-autonomous-agents-antonio-toni-) involves the agent learning to call external APIs for information missing from its training. This includes current data, code execution, proprietary data sources, and more.\n\n## 9. Integration with Other Tools\n\n[LLMs can be augmented with other tools](https://causalens.com/resources/blogs/enterprise-decision-making-needs-more-than-chatbots/) to improve their reasoning abilities. For example, they can be integrated with Causal AI to measure the impact of one’s decisions.\n\n## 10. Experimentation\n\nFinally, [experimentation](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.241/) is important to find what works best for your specific use case. This could involve testing different prompt variations, hyperparameters, or even different LLMs.\n\nRemember, improving reasoning in autonomous agents using LLMs is an ongoing process that requires continuous learning and adaptation. Always be open to new techniques and approaches as they emerge.\n\n# Other Methods and Resources\n\n- [ReST meets ReAct: Self-Improvement for Multi-Step Reasoning LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10003) - ReAct-style LLM agent with the ability to reason and act upon external knowledge that iteratively trains on previous trajectories, employing growing-batch reinforcement learning with AI feedback for continuous self-improvement and self-distillation.\n",

    content:
      "# Mechanisms for Optimizing Resource Allocation\n\n**1. Participatory Budgeting:**\n   - **Mechanism:** Allows members of the Positron Network, particularly those in individual Mission Networks, to have a direct say in how funding is allocated.\n   - **Implementation:** Non-profits within each Mission Network could vote on funding allocation for various projects or Task Agents. Each organization gets a vote proportional to its stake or contribution in the network, ensuring a democratic approach.\n   - **Outcome:** This method empowers members, fostering a sense of community and ensuring that funds are directed to projects that have broad support and are aligned with the collective mission.\n\n**2. Quadratic Public Goods Funding:**\n   - **Mechanism:** Uses a quadratic funding formula, where the value of each additional vote decreases. This encourages wider participation and gives more power to the collective preferences of smaller contributors.\n   - **Implementation:** When allocating funds, the influence of each vote is determined by this quadratic formula. This system could be used in crowdfunding scenarios where multiple non-profits contribute to a common pool for Task Agent development.\n   - **Outcome:** Quadratic funding can potentially balance the influence of large and small organizations, ensuring that the allocation reflects the broader preference of the network rather than just the wealthiest members.\n\n**3. Retroactive Public Goods Funding:**\n   - **Mechanism:** Funds are allocated retroactively based on the demonstrated impact of projects or Task Agents.\n   - **Implementation:** A portion of the budget is set aside for retroactive funding. Once Task Agents or projects complete their objectives, their impact is evaluated. Funding is then distributed based on the value they added to the network's goals.\n   - **Outcome:** This method incentivizes effective performance and results, as organizations are aware that their efforts and successes can lead to additional funding.\n\n**Integration in the Positron Network:**\n- **Unified System:** The network could integrate these three methods into a unified funding allocation system. For example, a portion of the budget could be allocated through participatory budgeting, another through quadratic funding for new initiatives, and the rest retroactively based on performance.\n- **Transparent Process:** Using these methods requires a transparent, well-documented process, ensuring all members understand how decisions are made and funds are allocated.\n- **Technology Utilization:** The Positron Network’s technology, especially its data analysis and performance monitoring capabilities, can be leveraged to support these funding methods, ensuring accurate tracking of contributions, impact, and member preferences.\n\nBy combining these innovative funding mechanisms, the Positron Network can create a more equitable, effective, and community-driven system for allocating resources, thereby enhancing the collective impact of its non-profit members.\n",

      "# Positron Network Architect Agent Overview\n\n### Purpose\nThe Positron Network Architect Agent  primary objective is to ensure a structured, efficient, and scalable design that aligns with the overarching goals of the network.\n\n### Functions\nThe agent plays a pivotal role in:\n- Analyzing and synthesizing complex system requirements.\n- Structuring the Positron Network's architecture for optimal performance and adaptability.\n- Documenting each aspect of the network's design in an accessible and detailed manner.\n\n### Design Principles\nIn its design, the agent embodies principles of clarity, scalability, and future-proofing, ensuring that the Positron Network remains adaptable to evolving technological landscapes and organizational needs.\n\n## Responsibilities\n\n1. **Decision-Making Process**: The agent should facilitate the decision-making process in software development, including choices about programming languages, architectures, processes, and tools.\n\n2. **RFC Documentation**: The agent should be capable of creating RFCs, which are relatively informal documents documenting high-level implementation strategies and critical design decisions, along with the trade-offs considered.\n\n3. **Collaborative Participation**: It should enable individual contributors and domain experts to participate in decision-making, even if they are not directly involved in building a specific system. This would include improving risk management and providing a clear context for decisions.\n\n4. **Repository Management**: The agent should manage a repository (e.g., on GitHub) to store RFC documents. It should allow team members to create branches, copy templates, write new RFCs in Markdown format, and open Pull Requests (PRs). The agent should facilitate the review process, where team members can comment and suggest changes in the PRs, and then either merge the accepted RFCs or close the unaccepted ones.\n## References\n\n1.

      "# Self-Improving GitHub Repository\n\nThe goal is to turn this project is to create a self-improving GitHub repository.\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] Create a Prisma schema for storing Agent definitions, including objectives and data sources.  See https://github.com/wishonia/wishonia/blob/main/prisma/schema.prisma#L381\n- [ ] Implement a library/endpoint/UI/tests for creating updating agents (objectives/data sources) based on the Prisma schema.\n- [ ] Develop a library/endpoint/UI/test for adding data sources starting with GitHub repositories that can be assigned to agents.  See \n- [ ] Create an API endpoint for creating agents and assigning data sources to them.\n- [ ] Page for managing agents, allowing users to create, edit, and delete agents, as well as assign data sources.\n- [ ] Page creating and editing agent objectives and data sources.\n- [X] Design a Prisma schema for mirroring the GitHub issues API response, including comments and related models. See https://github.com/wishonia/wishonia/blob/main/prisma/schema.prisma#L591\n- [ ] Implement a GitHub sync library for syncing repository data, issues, and comments using Octokit.\n- [ ] Generate embeddings for the indexed repository data, either by adding an `embeddings` field to the existing tables or creating separate embedding tables linked to the GitHub tables. Using an embeddings table is simplest, but the content of each record may need to have multiple chunks in which case, it would require multiple records and wouldn't be able to be stored in a single embeddings field. Here are some instructions  https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/indexing/ to create embeddings without wasting money on reindexing content that already has embeddings. It also should update embeddings and delete the old ones when the files in the repo change based on the github repo changelog.\n- [ ] Set up a sync job using GitHub Actions and/or webhooks to regularly update the tables and embeddings.\n- [ ] Create a chat endpoint/UI for querying the embeddings, which will be used by agents for commenting on issues, adding context, generating code, and in API endpoints and chat interfaces.\n- [ ] Design and implement the following agents in the UI for managing the GitHub project:\n    - [ ] Project Manager Agent\n    - [ ] Issue Triager Agent\n    - [ ] Requirements Analyzer Agent\n    - [ ] Solution Architect Agent\n    - [ ] Development Team Agent\n    - [ ] Code Reviewer Agent\n    - [ ] Issue Commenter Agent\n    - [ ] Continuous Integration (CI) Agent\n    - [ ] Documentation Agent\n    - [ ] Prisma Schema Manager Agent\n    - [ ] API Endpoint Generator Agent\n    - [ ] UI Component Generator Agent\n- [ ] Develop the necessary tools (https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/expression_language/cookbook/tools/) and capabilities for the agents, including:\n    - [ ] Repository Querying Tool with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n    - [ ] Issue Creation and Management Tool\n    - [ ] Issue Search and Filtering Tool\n    - [ ] Pull Request Management Tool\n- [ ] Implement the decision-making process for the agents, following the provided decision tree diagram.\n- [ ] Set up continuous monitoring and self-improvement mechanisms for the agents to identify and implement improvements.\n- [ ] Establish a process for handling limitations and seeking human intervention when necessary.\n- [ ] Conduct thorough testing and validation of the self-improving GitHub repository system.\n- [ ] Deploy the system and monitor its performance, making adjustments as needed.\n- [ ] Continuously iterate and improve the system based on feedback and identified areas for enhancement.\n\n## Step 1: Create function for creating agents\n\nWe need to store the Agent definitions (objectives, their data sources) in the Postgres database using the [Prisma schema](../../../prisma/schema.prisma). \n\nSee Agent model in https://github.com/wishonia/wishonia/blob/main/prisma/schema.prisma#L418\n\n## Step 2. Create Jest test for agent creation\n\nWe need to create a Jest test to ensure that the agents are created correctly and that they can be queried from the database.\n\n## Step 3. Create function for adding GitHub repos as data sources that can be assigned to agents\n\nWe need to create a function that allows us to add GitHub repositories as data sources that can be assigned to agents. This will allow the agents to access the repository data and perform their tasks.\n\nSee AgentSource model in https://github.com/wishonia/wishonia/blob/main/prisma/schema.prisma#L418\n\n## Create API Endpoint for Creating Agents\n\nWe need to create an API endpoint that allows us to create agents and assign data sources to them. This will allow us to manage the agents and their data sources through a web interface.\n\n## Create Page for Managing Agents\n\nWe need to create a web page that allows us to manage the agents and their data sources. This page should allow us to create, edit, and delete agents, as well as assign data sources to them.\n\n## Create Page for Creating/Editing Agent Objective and Data Sources\n\nWe need to create a web page that allows us to create and edit agent objectives and data sources. \nThis page should allow us to define the objectives of the agents and assign data sources to them.\n\n## Create GitHub Sync Library for GitHub Repo Data Sources\n\nWe need to index the repository, issues, and comments to create a tool to allow the agents to know what's been built already and provide links to files and ask questions about the project. This will be necessary for all the coding and project management agents.\n\nTo do this,\nwe created tables in the Prisma schema that mirror the GitHub issues API response including comments and related models.\nSee GitHub models in https://github.com/wishonia/wishonia/blob/main/prisma/schema.prisma#L591\n\n**Generate Embeddings**\n\nFor generating the embeddings,\nwe can either create an `embeddings` field on the table or a separate embeddings table(s)\nthat can be linked to the GitHub tables.\n\n\n## Step 5: Create GitHub Action and/or Webhooks for Syncing GitHub Repo Data\n\nThen we'll need to create a sync job to update the tables and embeddings on a regular basis.\n\n## Step 6: Create Function for Querying Embeddings\n\nWe'll want a function for querying the embeddings. This will be used in\n- Agents for commenting on issues, adding context, generating code, etc.\n- An API endpoint for querying the embeddings\n- A chat web interface for querying the embeddings\n\nThe function should return the top N most relevant chunks of text from the issue, comments, and related files and links to the sources.\n\n# References\n- https://github.com/run-llama/LlamaIndexTS/blob/main/examples/anthropic/agent.ts\n- https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions&query=todo+\n- https://dosu.dev/\n- https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/expression_language/cookbook/retrieval/\n- https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/expression_language/cookbook/tools/\n- https://github.com/Codium-ai/pr-agent/blob/main/pr_agent/tools/pr_code_suggestions.py\n\n# Create Agents in the UI for managing the GitHub project\n\nTo design a process where AI agents manage a GitHub project, automatically plan and prioritize development, and create and make helpful comments on GitHub issues, we would need several specialized agents with focused objectives.

    content:
      '\nA crowdsourced budget allocation platform aims to maximize universal preference satisfaction by allowing users to propose, vote on, and implement budget allocations for various ideas.\n\n# Features:\n\n1. **Welcome Screen**: The app starts with a welcome screen that introduces the app\'s purpose, features, and a call-to-action (CTA) button to sign up or log in.\n\n2. **Sign Up/Log In**: Users will be prompted to create an account or log in with their existing credentials. Social media integration can be provided for easy sign-up.\n\n3. **Dashboard**: After a successful login, the user is directed to the dashboard, which provides an overview of ongoing projects, available budget, and upcoming tasks. The dashboard should have clear navigation to other sections of the app.\n\n4. **Create Project**: A button or link should be available on the dashboard to create a new project. This section will include a form for users to input project details, such as project name, description, budget, and deadline.\n\n5. **Project Details**: This screen displays the details of an individual project. It should include the project\'s title, description, budget, deadline, and a progress bar. Users can view the budget allocation details, contributors, and any attached files.\n\n6. **Budget Allocation**: This section allows users to view the proposed budget allocations, submit their suggestions, and vote on existing proposals. The app should display a visual representation of the budget allocation (e.g., pie chart or bar graph) and a list of proposals ranked by votes.\n\n7. **Propose Allocation**: This screen includes a form for users to suggest budget allocations for different aspects of the project. They can input a title, description, and proposed budget allocation for each item.\n\n8. **Voting**: Users can vote on different budget allocation proposals in this section. They can sort proposals by popularity, date, or other criteria. Users can also view the details of each proposal and leave comments.\n\n9. **Notifications**: This section provides updates on projects, new proposals, and voting results. Users can customize their notification preferences.\n\n10. **Profile**: Users can view and edit their profile information, including name, email, and profile picture. They can also view their past contributions and track their reputation within the app.\n\n11. **Settings**: This section allows users to customize their app experience, such as changing the app\'s theme, managing notifications, and connecting to social media accounts.\n\n* **Web3 Login**: In the Sign-Up/Log In screen, add the option for users to log in using their web3 wallets (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect). This will provide a secure, decentralized login method and facilitate seamless integration with blockchain-based services.\n\n* **Aragon DAO Integration**: The app can be connected to the Aragon framework, which allows for the creation and management of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). In the "Create Project" screen, include an option to "Create DAO" with the project. When a user creates a new project and selects this option, the app will automatically create an Aragon DAO associated with the project. In the "Project Details" screen, display a link to the DAO\'s governance dashboard on Aragon.\n\n* **Token Creation**: As part of the project creation process, integrate an option for users to create a custom ERC-20 token for their project. In the "Create Project" screen, include a section for users to specify the token name, symbol, and initial supply. Once the project is created, the app will automatically deploy a smart contract on the Ethereum network for the new token.\n\n* **Daily Token Allocation**: Implement a smart contract that distributes one token daily to each active user. In the "Settings" section, include an option for project creators to enable or disable this feature. If enabled, the app will interact with the smart contract to claim tokens for each user daily. In the "Dashboard" and "Profile" screens, display the user\'s token balance and an option to claim their daily token allocation.\n',

    content:
      "\n\n**Goal**: Optimally allocate scarce resources such that they maximize median health and happiness. \n\n# Abstract Approach:\nUse collective AI and human intelligence to:\n1. generate a list of actions humans or AI agents could take to achieve the goal.\n2. prioritize the list of actions based on their expected impact on the goal\n3. allocate resources to the human or AI agents that are most likely to succeed in implementing the actions at the lowest cost.\n4. monitor the results of the actions and adjust the list of actions and resource allocation as needed\n5. repeat steps 1-4 until the goal is achieved.\n\n# Concrete Approach:\n1. Create a website where people (Wishers) can submit an action that would most cost-effectively increase median health and happiness\n2. Show the Wishers two random wishes at a time and ask them to vote for the one that would most cost-effectively increase median health and happiness (binary choice or maybe with a slider)\n3. Aggregate the vote results of the pairwise comparisons to rank the ideas by their expected increase in median health and happiness\n4. Allow people (Genies) to propose an action they can take that will contribute to the fulfillment of the highest-ranked wish\n5. Show people 2 proposed actions at a time and ask them to choose the one that is most likely to succeed at the lowest cost\n6. Aggregate the results of the pairwise comparisons to rank the proposed actions by their expected success at the lowest cost\n\nExample Wish: I wish all the governments of the world would sign a treaty\nto redirect 1% of spending on war to a democratic platform to fund cures for diseases.\nExample Action: I will write a letter to the president of the United States asking him to sign the treaty.\n\n\n**How Wishocracy Works**\n========================\n\nWishocracy is a unique platform that uses the power of collective intelligence to identify and prioritize the most important wishes for society. It then allocates resources to the most promising solutions using a novel approach called Aggregated Pairwise Preference Allocation.\n\n**Discovering the Most Impactful Wishes**\n=========================================\n\nWishocracy allows people to submit wishes they believe would have the greatest positive impact on the world. Through a process of voting and discussion, the community collectively determines which wishes are the most important to focus on.\n\n**GenieDAOs: Teams United by a Common Wish**\n============================================\n\nGenieDAOs are special teams formed within Wishocracy where people with shared passions and skills come together to work on a specific wish. These teams collaborate to develop innovative solutions and strategies to make their chosen wish a reality.\n\n**WishTokens: Funding Solutions through Proposals**\n===================================================\n\nGenieDAOs can submit detailed proposals outlining their plans to fulfill a wish. The community then votes on these proposals using WishTokens, a unique funding mechanism. The proposals with the most votes receive the necessary resources to implement their solutions.\n\n**Aggregated Pairwise Preference Allocation: Making Decisions through Comparisons**\n========================================================\n\nWishocracy uses a novel voting system called Aggregated Pairwise Preference Allocation to make decisions. Instead of voting on many options at once, people are presented with pairs of wishes or proposals and asked to choose the one they prefer. This process is repeated many times, and the results are used to determine which wishes and proposals are the most popular and should be prioritized.\n",

      '# Wishonia\n\nWishonia is a virtual world where 8 billion digital twins of every person on Earth. \nOur digital twins are AI agents that mirror our desires, values, resources, and knowledge as closely as possible. \nAs we sleep, they work tirelessly to figure out how to organize the world to ensure everyone gets as much of what they want as physically possible.  \n\nThis world leverages the full potential of AI and digital technology to enhance real-world outcomes through its virtual institutions. Here\'s a breakdown of how these institutions could function and impact the real world:\n\n1. **Wishonian Congress:**\n   - The problem with what we call representative democracy is that it makes everyone completely forget the point. We think the point is to fight over which dementia patient to give the nuclear codes to. What we were supposed to be "protecting and promoting the general welfare."  This means maximizing universal health and happiness.\n   - Truly Representative Democracy: Every digital twin is a voting member, constantly debating and voting on issues that affect their real-life counterparts. This continuous legislative process ensures that every voice is heard and represented.\n   - Practical Benefit: Offers a model for more inclusive and representative governance, potentially influencing real-world democratic processes and policies.\n\n2. **Wishonia United Nations:**\n   - This institution facilitates seamless and instantaneous communication between digital twins of all nations, overcoming language barriers and cultural misunderstandings. Through AI-powered translation and sentiment analysis, every digital twin can understand and empathize with each other, leading to more informed and harmonious global decision-making.\n   - Practical Benefit: Encourages global cooperation and understanding, potentially influencing real-world international policies and peacekeeping efforts.\n\n3. **Wishonia FDA (Food and Drug Administration):**\n   - Conducts comprehensive, eternal observational studies on every digital twin, analyzing the impact of various exposure factors on health outcomes. This data is richer and more varied than any real-world study could achieve.\n   - Practical Benefit: Provides invaluable insights into public health and medicine, influencing real-world drug development, dietary guidelines, and lifestyle recommendations.\n\n4. **Virtual SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission):**\n   - The real SEC spends a great deal of its time trying to prevent poor people from being able to escape poverty.  They do this by only allowing accredited investors (rich people) access to early stage, high growth opportunities.\n   - With unlimited resources, this virtual SEC monitors internet activities could actually do its job to protect individuals from fraudulent schemes, especially in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. It balances consumer protection with the opportunity to participate in potentially life-changing early-stage investments.\n   - Practical Benefit: Helps shape real-world regulations that protect investors while fostering innovation and economic growth.\n\n5. **Wishonia CyberForce:**\n   - Employs powerful AI to investigate, prevent, and shut down cybercrime operations. Its capabilities far exceed any current real-world organization in tracking and neutralizing online threats.\n   - Practical Benefit: Contributes to global cybersecurity strategies, reducing the prevalence and impact of cybercrimes in the real world.\n\n6. **Wishonian War Crimes Commission:**\n   - Imposes financial penalties on digital representations of entities violating human rights, creating a powerful deterrent. \n   - Practical Benefit: Raises awareness and could pressure real-world entities to adhere to international human rights laws.\n\n7. **Wishonian Police:**\n   - Uses advanced techniques like DDoS attacks to neutralize malevolent AI and digital threats, ensuring the safety and integrity of online spaces.\n   - Practical Benefit: Serves as a model for effective digital law enforcement, potentially influencing real-world strategies against AI-based threats.\n\n8. **Wishonia Economic Forum:**\n   - Simulates various economic policies and predicts outcomes, guiding real-world economic decisions and policies.\n\nThe profound integration of these virtual institutions in Wishonia could serve as a blueprint for solving real-world problems. By testing policies and strategies in a simulated environment, real-world decision-makers could be better informed and equipped to tackle global challenges. This would represent a harmonious blend of virtual foresight and real-world action.\n',
