    "featuredImage": "/globalProblems/aging.jpg",
    "content": "# The Problem of Aging\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nAging is an inherent biological process affecting all living organisms, including humans. It leads to gradual physiological deterioration, which in turn influences health, well-being, and the socio-economic fabric of societies. The significance of this issue is profound as it impacts the quality of life, healthcare systems, and economic productivity on a global scale.\r\n\r\n## Causes and Contributing Factors\r\nAging results from complex biological mechanisms that include genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Cellular senescence, telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction, and epigenetic alterations are primary biological drivers. Historically, human lifespans have increased due to advancements in medicine, nutrition, and living conditions. However, this extended lifespan has not always corresponded to an increase in healthspan—the period during which individuals remain healthy and active.\r\n\r\n## Impact and Consequences\r\nThe negative impact of aging is considerable in terms of health, economic burden, and individual happiness. Age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s, cardiovascular problems, and osteoporosis cause significant suffering and disability. The global population of people aged 60 or older is expected to double by 2050, reaching nearly 2.1 billion. This demographic shift results in increased healthcare costs, estimated to reach trillions of dollars annually, and places immense pressure on healthcare systems and caregivers.\r\n\r\nSecondary consequences include a shrinking workforce, decreased economic productivity, and higher dependency ratios, affecting the overall economy. Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that age-related diseases contribute to the majority of global disease burden. Efforts to address aging can lead to ethical dilemmas, create disparities in access to care, and could potentially result in overpopulation if significantly extended lifespans are achieved.\r\n\r\n## Current Approaches and Interventions\r\nCurrent strategies to address aging and its effects include medical research focused on age-related diseases, public health initiatives promoting healthy lifestyles, and emerging technologies like regenerative medicine. Pharmaceutical approaches aim to manage symptoms and slow degeneration, but their effectiveness varies. Interventions such as regular physical activity, balanced diets, and mental health support have shown positive outcomes in maintaining healthspan.\r\n\r\nEach strategy has strengths and weaknesses. Medical treatments often target specific illnesses but may come with side effects. Public health measures are preventive but require widespread adoption and behavior change, which can be challenging to achieve. Evidence shows mixed results, highlighting the need for multifaceted approaches.\r\n\r\n## Key Players and Organizations\r\nMain players in this field include research institutions like the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and companies such as Calico and Unity Biotechnology. Organizations like the WHO and the National Institute on Aging (NIA) also play critical roles, funding research and promoting public health strategies. These entities have made significant progress in understanding the biology of aging and developing potential interventions.\r\n\r\n## Challenges and Obstacles\r\nChallenges in addressing aging are multifaceted, including scientific, ethical, and socio-economic barriers. Scientifically, the complexity of aging processes poses a significant hurdle. Ethical concerns revolve around the fair distribution of anti-aging treatments and potential societal implications. Socio-economically, funding and resource allocation are critical issues, with current investments often insufficient given the scale of the problem.\r\n\r\nPotential solutions include increasing funding for aging research, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, and developing policies that ensure equitable access to emerging treatments. Public awareness and education about healthy aging practices are also crucial.\r\n\r\n## Resource Requirements and Costs\r\nEffectively addressing aging requires substantial resources. Financially, billions of dollars are needed to fund research, healthcare services, and public health initiatives. Human resources include scientists, healthcare professionals, and caregivers. Currently, resource allocation is inadequate, with significant gaps in funding and workforce capacity noted by various studies.\r\n\r\n## Potential Future Developments\r\nFuture advancements could include breakthroughs in biotechnology, such as gene editing, stem cell therapy, and novel pharmaceutical agents. Artificial intelligence and machine learning may improve diagnostics, personalized treatment plans, and predictive analytics for age-related diseases. Promising research areas include senolytics, drugs targeting senescent cells, and advancements in understanding the genetics of aging.\r\n\r\n## Beneficiaries and Stakeholders\r\nThe primary beneficiaries of solving aging are the elderly population, who would experience improved health and quality of life. Families and caregivers would benefit from reduced caregiving burdens. Societal benefits include increased economic productivity and reduced healthcare costs. Potential negative impacts could include overpopulation and resource depletion, which must be carefully managed.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\nAddressing the problem of aging is of critical importance given the profound and widespread impacts on health, well-being, and economic stability. Significant resources and coordinated efforts are required to tackle this multifaceted issue. While current strategies offer some promise, future innovations hold the potential to more effectively mitigate the negative effects of aging. Individuals and organizations considering contributing to efforts in this area should weigh the immense potential benefits against other global priorities, bearing in mind the intricate interplay of biological, ethical, and socio-economic factors.\r\n"

    "url": "/globalProblems/water-pollution",
    "description": "Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies due to harmful substances such as chemicals, waste, and microorganisms, leading to detrimental effects on ecosystems and human health.",
    "featuredImage": "/globalProblems/water-pollution.jpg",
    "content": "# Water Pollution\n\n## Introduction\n\nWater pollution is the contamination of water bodies such as lakes, rivers, oceans, and groundwater by harmful substances. It is a significant global issue with far-reaching consequences for human health, ecosystems, and the economy. The increasing industrialization and urbanization have exacerbated this problem, making it a critical area of concern for policymakers, environmentalists, and the general public.\n\n## Causes and Contributing Factors\n\n### Industrial Discharges\nIndustries release a variety of pollutants, including heavy metals, organic compounds, and chemicals, into water bodies. Notable pollutants include mercury, lead, and cadmium, which pose severe health risks. \n\n### Agricultural Runoff\nThe use of fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides in agriculture leads to nutrient and chemical runoff into water bodies. This can cause eutrophication and algal blooms, disrupting aquatic ecosystems.\n\n### Household Waste\nDomestic sewage and wastewater, often untreated or inadequately treated, release pathogens, nutrients, and chemicals into water bodies. \n\n### Historical Context\nBefore industrialization, water pollution was largely localized and less severe. The industrial revolution marked a significant shift, with increased discharge of pollutants into natural water bodies. Over time, regulatory measures have been implemented, but challenges persist.\n\n## Impact and Consequences\n\n### Human Health\nContaminated water is a vector for diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), waterborne diseases are responsible for an estimated 1.7 million deaths annually, primarily affecting children in developing countries.\n\n### Ecosystems\nAquatic ecosystems suffer from reduced biodiversity, with many species facing extinction due to polluted habitats. For instance, approximately 40% of freshwater fish species in North America are at risk of extinction due to polluted waters.\n\n### Economic Impact\nWater pollution affects industries reliant on clean water, such as fisheries and tourism. The estimated annual cost of water pollution in developed countries ranges from $4 to $23 billion, considering health costs, loss of biodiversity, and economic losses.\n\n### Secondary Consequences\nEutrophication caused by nutrient runoff can lead to hypoxic zones, which are dead zones devoid of oxygen. The Gulf of Mexico dead zone, primarily caused by agricultural runoff from the Mississippi River, spans an area of approximately 6,334 square miles.\n\n## Current Approaches and Interventions\n\n### Regulatory Measures\nGovernments worldwide have implemented regulations to control industrial discharges, such as the Clean Water Act in the USA and the Water Framework Directive in the EU. These regulations have led to significant, though incomplete, improvements in water quality.\n\n### Technological Solutions\nWastewater treatment plants and advanced agricultural practices (e.g., precision farming) are employed to reduce pollutant discharge. These approaches have shown effectiveness but require significant investment and maintenance.\n\n### Community Initiatives\nLocal efforts such as river clean-ups and pollution awareness campaigns aim to reduce pollution at a grassroots level. While impactful, their scale is often limited compared to the magnitude of the problem.\n\n## Key Players and Organizations\n\n### Government Agencies\nAgencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the USA and the European Environment Agency (EEA) play crucial roles in regulating and monitoring water pollution.\n\n### Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)\nOrganizations such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Greenpeace actively campaign against water pollution and promote conservation efforts. They contribute through advocacy, research, and community projects.\n\n### Scientific Community\nResearchers and academic institutions contribute by developing new technologies and methods for water purification and pollution control. For example, the development of biodegradable pesticides and more efficient water treatment processes are notable advancements.\n\n## Challenges and Obstacles\n\n### Lack of Enforcement\nWeak enforcement of laws and regulations, especially in developing countries, undermines efforts to control water pollution.\n\n### Economic Constraints\nHigh costs associated with the installation and maintenance of water treatment infrastructure limit their widespread adoption, particularly in low-income regions.\n\n### Knowledge Gaps\nIncomplete understanding of pollutant sources and their effects on ecosystems complicates effective intervention strategies.\n\n## Resource Requirements and Costs\n\n### Financial Resources\nEffective water pollution control requires substantial funding for infrastructure, monitoring, and enforcement. Estimates suggest that improving global water infrastructure could require investments of up to $150 billion annually.\n\n### Human Resources\nSkilled professionals for monitoring, research, and technological implementation are essential. This includes environmental scientists, engineers, and public health experts.\n\n### Current Gaps\nMany regions, particularly in developing countries, face significant resource shortfalls. For instance, sub-Saharan Africa has limited access to clean water and sanitation, affecting over 319 million people.\n\n## Potential Future Developments\n\n### Enhanced Treatment Technologies\nInnovations in nanotechnology and biotechnology could yield more efficient water purification methods. Biofilters and advanced membrane technologies are promising.\n\n### Policy Innovations\nStronger international cooperation and more stringent global regulations could improve enforcement and compliance with pollution controls.\n\n### Public Awareness\nIncreased awareness and education about water pollution can drive consumer behavior towards sustainable practices, influencing industrial and agricultural practices indirectly.\n\n## Beneficiaries and Stakeholders\n\n### General Population\nAccess to clean water universally improves public health outcomes and quality of life, potentially reducing disease burdens and healthcare costs.\n\n### Ecosystems\nHealthy aquatic ecosystems support biodiversity and resilience against climate change impacts. Cleaner water bodies can rejuvenate marine and freshwater life.\n\n### Economies\nClean water is a fundamental resource for various industries, including agriculture, fisheries, and tourism, ensuring sustainable economic growth and livelihoods.\n\n### Potential Negative Impacts\nIndustrial transition to pollution control may incur short-term economic losses or job displacements in heavily polluting sectors. Mitigating these impacts requires supportive policies such as job retraining programs.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWater pollution is a complex and critical issue with extensive impacts on human health, ecosystems, and economies. Despite existing regulatory measures and technological solutions, significant challenges remain, particularly in enforcement and resource allocation. Addressing water pollution requires a multi-faceted approach involving stronger regulations, technological innovation, public awareness, and international cooperation. Resources must be strategically allocated, and gaps in funding and expertise need to be addressed to make meaningful progress. Given these considerations, efforts to mitigate water pollution should be a high priority, with coordinated action from governments, NGOs, scientific communities, and the public. Contributing to this cause can have significant benefits, enhancing public health, environmental sustainability, and economic stability.\n"

    "name": "The 1% Treaty",
    "url": "/globalSolutions/1-percent-treaty/1-percent-treaty",
    "description": "A global accord to redirect 1% of military spending to discovering new treatments and cures for chronic diseases.",
    "featuredImage": "/globalSolutions/1-percent-treaty/1-percent-treaty.jpg",
    "content": "\n## Facts:\n\n1. **2 billion people suffer** from chronic diseases including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, autoimmune disorders, and many others. This causes immense human anguish as well as crippling economic costs.\n2. **Medical research** to find cures for these diseases remains far **too slow** to meet the desperate needs of patients.\n3. **Artificial intelligence** can radically accelerate the clinical research process by automating analysis of medical data, identifying promising drug targets, optimizing clinical trial designs, and more.\n4. A global collaborative effort to deploy AI to automate clinical research, coordinated and governed by the people, could produce revolutionary breakthroughs against chronic diseases and **alleviate the suffering of billions of people.**\n\n## Logical Proof:\n\nHere is the logical proof that signing this accord is the most rational thing you can do with the next few moments of your life:\n\n1. Governments currently spend over $2 trillion per year on their militaries. They don’t do this because they like blowing up other people and their stuff. They do this to maintain the balance of power against other nations that might blow them up.\n\n2. However, if every nation agreed to reallocate just 1% of their annual military expenditures to a global medical research fund:\n\n  * The relative balance of power would remain unchanged. So, despite spending less on the military, they would be at no greater relative risk of being murdered by another country.\n  * The entire world would benefit from the resulting health advances and cures for diseases.\n\n3. Therefore, it is clearly in your rational self-interest to sign this treaty requesting that all nations to cooperate in this endeavor. By contributing a infinitesimal portion of their military budgets, they can help unlock revolutionary health benefits for their own citizens and the world at large.\n\n## How it Works:\n\n1. Every participating nation will pledge **1% of its annual military budget** to the [Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)](decentralized-institutes-of-health.md). For example, if global military spending is $2 trillion per year, this would create a $20 billion annual fund. Participation from all nations is essential to maintain geopolitical stability.\n2. The **fund will support AI-driven research projects** aimed at discovering new treatments, cures, and early-detection methods for cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and other chronic diseases that take the heaviest toll on human health worldwide.\n3. Research institutions, medical centers, and AI labs around the world will be invited to **submit project proposals** to the fund. These proposals will be reviewed and ranked by a global panel of experts based on their scientific merit, feasibility, and potential impact.\n4. However, the final decision on which projects receive funding will be [**made democratically**](decentralized-institutes-of-health.md) by the global public. Using a [crowdfunding platform](decentralized-institutes-of-health.md), anyone in the world will be able to vote on the proposals they believe hold the most promise. This crowdsourced approach ensures that the fund remains accountable to the people and focused on the projects that matter most to them.\n5. All research findings and data generated through the fund will be made openly available in real-time to the global scientific community, **accelerating progress** and enabling rapid translation of discoveries into new medicines and improved clinical practices worldwide.\n6. Participating nations and research institutions will collaborate continuously through a state-of-the-art online platform, sharing knowledge, best practices, and resources to **maximize the impact of every research dollar** and speed the deployment of new health solutions to patients everywhere.\n\nBy combining the power of AI, the resources of global crowdfunding, and the collective wisdom of the world’s people, we can transform the fight against chronic disease. The resulting breakthroughs will improve health, extend lives, boost economies, and benefit every nation on Earth.\n\n# Cost of War\n\nThe direct and indirect costs of war come out to [$74,259](globalSolutions/1-percent-treaty/cost-of-war.mds/1-percent-treaty/cost-of-war.md) per person over an 80-year lifespan.\n\n# Cumulative Savings from Decreased Annual Cost of War\n\nReducing spending on war by 1% annually would reduce the per-person costs by [$22,969](savings-from-1-percent-less-war.md) over an 80-year lifespan.\n\n# Cost of Disease\n\nThe [**$244 trillion**](globalSolutions/1-percent-treaty/cost-of-disease.mdpercent-treaty/cost-of-disease.md) total global annual cost of disease is a comprehensive measure that encompasses direct healthcare costs, indirect economic losses, and the $100k valuation of a Year of Life Lost (YLL) and a $100k valuation Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALYs).\n\n# Redirecting 1% of Military Spending to Healthcare Innovation\n\n By redirecting just 1% of war spending each year to using AI to automate clinical research and personalized, preventive, precision medicine over 80 years, we would save lives, reduce disability, and significantly impact the global economy.  The monetary benefit of this shift would be approximately [$1,235,443](value-of-automating-research.md) per person over 80 years.\n\n# Total Net Benefit of Less War and More Cures\n\nThe total combined per capita net benefit of redirecting 1% of military spending to healthcare innovation over 80 years would be [$1,258,412](value-of-automating-research.md). \n\nThis is calculated by adding the [$22,969](savings-from-1-percent-less-war.md) savings from decreased annual cost of war to the [$1,235,443](value-of-automating-research.md) benefit of reducing the burden of chronic disease.\n\n# $1,258,412 for 5 Hours of Your Time\n\nHistorical examples show that petitions with support from over **1% of the population** have a high likelihood of being adopted. \n\nSo all you have to do is convince a small fraction of your friends to sign this treaty and convince them to convince a small fraction of their friends to sign this treaty and so on.\n\nGiven the average number of friends (150) and the estimated time per friend (2 minutes), an average person would need to invest approximately [5 hours](individual-roi.md) to individually reach out to all 150 of their friends via personal messages or emails about the treaty.\n\n\n"

    "content": "\nThe **$244 trillion** annual total global cost of disease encompasses direct healthcare costs, indirect economic losses, and the $100k valuation of a Year of Life Lost (YLL) and a $100k valuation Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALYs). \n\n## Direct Healthcare Costs\n\n- **Direct Annual Healthcare Expenditures:** $8.5 trillion, representing the cost of medical treatments, medications, hospital stays, and other healthcare services.\n\n## Indirect Economic Losses\n\n- **Indirect Annual Economic Losses:** $4.7 trillion, reflecting the broader economic impact of diseases on productivity and output.\n\n## Economic Valuation of YLL and DALYs\n\nThe value assigned to a Year of Life Lost (YLL) and a Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) can vary significantly depending on the context, purpose of the valuation, and the economic framework applied. These values are used in health economics to inform public health policy, prioritize healthcare interventions, and allocate resources efficiently. The methodology and the specific value can differ by country, healthcare system, and the economic conditions of the area under consideration.\n\n### Value of a YLL\n\nThe value of a YLL typically reflects the economic loss associated with premature mortality. This can be based on potential future earnings lost due to early death or the willingness to pay to reduce the risk of dying prematurely. The approach can vary:\n\n- **Human Capital Approach:** Often calculates lost future earnings, sometimes adjusted for factors like expected work-life years remaining and productivity growth rates.\n- **Value of Statistical Life (VSL):** Based on individuals' willingness to pay for marginal reductions in their risk of dying. VSL is widely used in policy settings and can vary greatly between countries and within countries over time, often ranging from a few million to tens of millions of dollars.\n\n### Value of a DALY\n\nThe value of a DALY attempts to quantify the burden of both morbidity and mortality. It integrates the value of life years lost due to premature death and the value of life years lived with disability. Valuing a DALY can follow similar principles to valuing a YLL but also considers the costs and quality of life associated with living with disabilities and diseases. Like YLL, the valuation methods can include:\n\n- **Cost of Illness (COI):** Incorporates direct medical costs, indirect costs like lost productivity, and sometimes intangible costs related to pain and suffering.\n- **Willingness to Pay (WTP):** Estimates based on how much individuals are willing to pay for interventions that reduce the risk of illness or disability.\n\n### Typical Values\n\nWhile specific monetary values can vary widely, a common approach in international health policy analysis is to value a DALY at 1 to 3 times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of a country. This approach provides a benchmark that adjusts for the economic conditions of the country. For instance, in a country with a GDP per capita of $50,000, a DALY might be valued between $50,000 and $150,000.\n\n\n### Economic Valuation of Excess Mortality (YLL)\n\nTo monetize YLL, we adopt a conservative value that reflects the economic loss due to premature mortality. Assuming an average income approach or a statistical value of life approach, we might assign a figure like $100,000 per YLL. If we base our calculation on the WHO's reported 63 million excess deaths annually:\n\n- **YLL Economic Valuation:** $100,000 per YLL * YLLs (calculated from 63 million excess deaths with an average YLL estimate per death).\n\n### Economic Valuation of Morbidity and Disability (DALYs)\n\nFor DALYs, which combine YLL with Years Lived with Disability (YLD), we use a similar valuation approach. Assigning a value to each DALY reflects the cost of both premature death and living with disability. Assuming $100,000 per DALY as a conservative estimate:\n\n- **DALY Economic Valuation:** $100,000 per DALY * 1.68 billion DALYs.\n\n## Total Annual Economic Impact: Calculations\n\nFor YLL, assuming an average of 10 years lost per death, and for DALYs, directly applying the $100,000 valuation:\n\n1. **YLL Economic Impact:** Assuming 63 million excess deaths and an average YLL per death, with a specific valuation per YLL.\n2. **DALY Economic Impact:** 1.68 billion DALYs valued at $100,000 each.\n\nThese calculations provide us with a monetary estimate of the total global burden of disease, incorporating both health outcomes and direct plus indirect economic losses. \n\nThe calculations incorporating economic valuations for Years of Life Lost (YLL) and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) yield the following insights into the global disease burden:\n\n- **Economic Impact of Excess Mortality (YLL):** $63 trillion, based on the valuation of years of life lost due to premature mortality.\n- **Economic Impact of Morbidity and Disability (DALYs):** $168 trillion, reflecting the combined cost of premature death and living with disability.\n\nThis leads to a **Total Annual Economic Impact** of the global disease burden of approximately $244.2 trillion. This total encompasses:\n\n- Direct Healthcare Costs: $8.5 trillion\n- Indirect Economic Losses: $4.7 trillion\n- Economic Valuation of YLL: $63 trillion\n- Economic Valuation of DALYs: $168 trillion\n\n\n"

    "content": "# Why Current Military Spending is Excessive\n\nIf you simply consider one part of military spending, nuclear weapons, we already have 13,000 nuclear weapons. This is enough to cause between 13 and 130 \"extinction-level events\" if you account for the effects of nuclear winter.  \n\nEven if you believe some level of military spending is warranted, we certainly don't need to be able to exterminate the human race more than once.\n\nYet, we keep increasing military spending by $42 billion dollars a year.\n\n![military-spending-scenarios-chart.png](military-spending-scenarios-chart.png)\n\n\n## Calculations\n\nGiven the rough estimate that 100 to 1,000 nuclear detonations could potentially trigger a nuclear winter sufficient to cause global agricultural collapse and widespread famine, potentially endangering the majority of the world's population, the concept of \"extinction-level events\" becomes more nuanced when considering the long-term environmental impact rather than direct fatalities alone.\n\nIf we work with the assumption from earlier calculations that the entire global nuclear arsenal (approximately 13,000 warheads) has the \"theoretical kill capability\" to exterminate the world's population approximately 1.625 times based solely on direct impacts, incorporating the effects of nuclear winter complicates the picture:\n\n- **Direct Impact**: Without considering nuclear winter, 13,000 warheads could theoretically kill the global population 1.625 times.\n- **Nuclear Winter Impact**: If 100 to 1,000 warheads are sufficient to trigger a catastrophic nuclear winter potentially leading to the majority of the global population's demise, then the arsenal could cause the conditions for global catastrophe many times over.\n\n### Theoretical Extinction-Level Events Calculation\n\n- **Lower Bound (100 warheads/event)**: With 13,000 warheads, you could have 130 \"events\" where each event is defined as a scenario sufficient to potentially trigger a nuclear winter.\n- **Upper Bound (1,000 warheads/event)**: With 13,000 warheads, you could have 13 \"events,\" where each event represents a larger scale scenario sufficient to potentially trigger a nuclear winter.\n\nBased on the assumption that between 100 and 1,000 warheads could cause catastrophic global climate effects leading to widespread famine and societal collapse, the global nuclear arsenal could theoretically cause between 13 and 130 \"extinction-level events.\" This calculation frames the concept of \"extinction-level events\" in terms of potential to trigger widespread ecological and societal collapse, rather than direct fatalities alone.\n\n## The Existential Threat of the AI Arms Race\n\nIn an era where artificial intelligence (AI) advancements hold the potential to redefine warfare, humanity faces an unprecedented existential challenge. The prospect of an AI arms race, with nations vying for supremacy in military AI technologies, poses threats far beyond traditional conflicts, edging us closer to potential catastrophe. The 1% Treaty, proposing that countries allocate just 1% of their military budgets towards AI safety and ethical research, stands as a crucial initiative to counteract these dangers, fostering a collaborative global approach to prevent AI-induced human extinction.\n\nThe AI arms race carries inherent risks that are distinct and potentially more perilous than any technological competition humanity has faced:\n\n- **Autonomous Decision-making**: AI systems capable of making lethal decisions without human intervention present an unpredictable threat. Unlike humans, who possess moral judgment and fear of mutual destruction, AI lacks such constraints, potentially leading to unintended escalations.\n- **Acceleration and Opaqueness**: The pace at which AI technologies can evolve surpasses traditional arms development, making it difficult for regulatory bodies to keep up. Additionally, the opaque nature of AI algorithms can obscure their decision-making processes, making it challenging to predict or control their actions in conflict scenarios.\n- **Cyber and Physical Vulnerabilities**: Military AI applications extend to cyber operations, where AI can exploit vulnerabilities at speeds and with a level of sophistication unattainable by humans. Physical security is equally at risk, with drones and autonomous vehicles opening new fronts in warfare that can be difficult to defend against.\n- **Global Instability**: The diffusion of AI technologies means that not only state actors but also non-state actors could acquire capabilities to conduct high-impact operations, potentially destabilizing regions or triggering international conflicts.\n\n## The 1% Treaty's Role in Mitigating Risks\n\nThe risks associated with the AI arms race necessitate immediate and unified action to prevent a drift towards catastrophe. The 1% Treaty offers a pragmatic approach to demilitarization, aiming to repurpose a fraction of the world's military expenditures towards ensuring AI benefits humanity rather than leading to its demise. By addressing the multifaceted threats of an AI arms race and fostering an environment of cooperation and safety, the treaty paves the way for a future where technological advancements are synonymous with global security and prosperity. In the face of AI's dual-use nature, the choice to embrace demilitarization and collaborative governance is not just strategic—it's essential for our survival.\n"

    "content": "# FAQ\n\n## Q: Why focus on reducing military spending? Shouldn't we just increase health research funding directly?\n\nWhile increasing health research funding through any means is valuable, tying it to a small reduction in military spending serves several purposes. First, it provides a clear funding source that doesn't take away from other priorities. Second, it sparks a conversation about the opportunity costs of our current resource allocation and whether it aligns with our values. Third, it creates a mechanism for global cooperation and trust-building as nations take this step together. Finally, even a small shift from militarism to health sends a powerful signal about the world we want to build.\n\n## Q: Is a 1% reduction in military budgets really enough to make a difference?\n\nWhile 1% may seem small, it translates to around $20 billion per year globally - a transformative sum for health research. \n\nIt's also important to remember that this is intended as a starting point, not an end goal. As countries experience the benefits of this reallocation, they may be inspired to go further. \n\nEven a 1% shift sets a crucial precedent and begins to normalize the idea of prioritizing health over warfare.\n\n## Q: How can we ensure that countries actually follow through on their commitments?\n\nThe treaty should include robust auditing and verification mechanisms to hold countries accountable. This could involve regular reporting, independent inspections, and penalties for non-compliance. Blockchain technology could also create transparent, tamper-proof records of contributions. Ultimately, the treaty's power will come from the collective weight of global norms and diplomatic pressure as much as formal enforcement.\n\n## Q: Won't reducing military strength make countries more vulnerable?\n\nSo there are two ways to increase national security:\n\n1. Have an endless arms race where everyone keeps spending more and more on weapons.\n2. All countries will be reducing their military budgets proportionally, so the balance of power remains unchanged. \nNo country gains a military advantage. \n\nIn fact,\nthe national security of everyone would be _**increased**_ because all their enemies would have 1% less bombs,\nbiological weapons, etc. to destroy them with.\n\n## Q: How can we be sure the research funding will be spent effectively?\n\nThe proposal's decentralized, crowdsourced approach is designed to maximize impact.\nBy transparently allowing scientists, institutions, and the public to propose and vote on projects, it taps into collective wisdom and promotes accountability. \nRigorous reporting on outcomes will also allow continuous improvement and ensure that funds flow to the most promising work.\nWhile no system is perfect, this approach offers significant advantages over centralized, opaque allocation processes vulnerable to special interests.\n\n## Q: Is it really possible to get a global treaty ratified in today's polarized geopolitical climate?\n\nAdmittedly, securing a global agreement is a daunting challenge.\n\nHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a unique window of opportunity by highlighting our shared vulnerability and the importance of scientific cooperation.\n\nWith enough grassroots momentum and smart diplomacy,\nleaders may find the political will to come together around this common cause.\nThe key is presenting the treaty not as an ideological stance,\nbut as an apolitical, practical solution that benefits everyone.\n\nBy starting with an achievable 1% target and demonstrating clear gains, we can build trust for more ambitious cooperation over time.\n\n## Q: Don't we already spend a lot on medical research?\n\nEven if your country is a leader in health research, a global effort will yield benefits that no nation can achieve alone.\n\nDiseases don't respect borders, and breakthroughs in one part of the world can save lives everywhere.\n\nBy pooling resources and expertise on a global scale, we accelerate progress and ensure fair access to treatments. \n\nWe also reduce the risk of devastating cross-border biological threats, enhancing everyone's security. Supporting this treaty is a recognition that, in our interconnected age, health is a global public good that requires collective action.\n"

    "content": "# How Much Will It Cost to Make It Happen?\n\nHere's the potential range of cost per signature for various strategies to gather 80 million signatures for a global initiative like the LOGICAL Treaty. Then, we'll calculate the total estimated cost for achieving this goal through each method.\n\n### 1. Traditional Advertising\n\n- **Cost per Signature**: $1 to $5\n- **Total Cost for 80 Million Signatures**: $80 million to $400 million\n\n### 2. Referral and Incentive System\n\n- **Cost per Signature**: Around $0.16 (after optimizations)\n- **Total Cost for 80 Million Signatures**: Approximately $12.8 million\n\n### 3. Crypto Token Sale for Funding\n\n- **Initial Startup Cost**: $85,000 to $550,000 (for establishing the DAO and related infrastructure)\n- **Cost per Signature**: $0.05 to $0.50 (assuming successful fundraising and effective fund utilization)\n- **Total Cost for 80 Million Signatures** (excluding initial startup costs): $4 million to $40 million\n\n### 4. Social Media and Viral Campaigns\n\n- **Cost per Signature**: $0.05 to $0.50\n- **Total Cost for 80 Million Signatures**: $4 million to $40 million\n\n### 5. Volunteer Networks\n\n- **Cost per Signature**: $0.01 to $0.10\n- **Total Cost for 80 Million Signatures**: $800,000 to $8 million\n\n### 6. Partnership with Influencers and Organizations\n\n- **Cost per Signature**: $0.10 to $0.40\n- **Total Cost for 80 Million Signatures**: $8 million to $32 million\n\n### Combining Strategies\n\nCombining various strategies to gather 80 million signatures for a global initiative can offer cost efficiencies and leverage the strengths of different approaches. Here's an analysis of the overall potential cost for achieving this ambitious goal using a multi-strategy approach:\n\n### Combined Strategies Approach:\n\n1. **Volunteer Networks** for grassroots mobilization.\n2. **Social Media and Viral Campaigns** for broad reach and engagement.\n3. **Referral and Incentive System** to encourage and reward active participation.\n4. **Partnership with Influencers and Organizations** for credibility and wider exposure.\n5. **Crypto Token Sale for Funding** to generate and manage the necessary financial resources efficiently.\n\n### Estimated Costs by Strategy (for 80 Million Signatures):\n\n- **Volunteer Networks**: Primarily non-monetary costs (e.g., organizing effort); let's allocate a nominal value for organizational support: $1 million.\n- **Social Media and Viral Campaigns**: Assuming high efficiency and virality, costs can be kept lower: $10 million.\n- **Referral and Incentive System**: Highly effective in driving participation at a low cost: $12.8 million.\n- **Partnership with Influencers and Organizations**: Varies widely; estimated support and marketing cost: $5 million.\n- **Crypto Token Sale for Funding**: Initial startup cost plus a buffer for operational and unforeseen expenses: $1 million (startup) + $4 million (buffer) = $5 million.\n\n### Estimating Combined Strategy Costs:\n\n- **Base Cost (Volunteer Networks & Social Media)**: Assuming this grassroots foundation keeps costs low, we could estimate $0.01 to $0.05 per signature for these efforts, given the minimal direct costs involved.\n\n- **Referral and Incentive Enhancements**: Adding in a well-optimized referral system might increase the cost slightly but still remain under $0.20 per signature due to the efficiency of peer-to-peer promotion.\n\n- **Supplementary Funding and Outreach**:\n  - **Crypto Token Sale**: The initial startup cost (not per signature) is $85,000 to $550,000, potentially offset by the funds raised.\n  - **Partnerships and Advertising**: Additional costs for partnerships and targeted advertising could increase the average cost, but leveraging funds from the token sale and focusing on cost-effective partnerships could keep increases minimal.\n\n### Potential Cost Range for 80 Million Signatures:\n\nGiven the base and enhanced approaches:\n\n- **Lower Bound**: $0.01 to $0.05 per signature for primarily volunteer and social media-driven efforts, plus the efficiency of a referral program, could lead to a minimal increase.\n  - **Total Cost Range**: $800,000 to $4 million.\n\n- **Upper Bound**: Considering some use of paid advertising and partnerships, and assuming efficient use of funds from a crypto sale to cover these costs effectively, the per signature cost might slightly increase.\n  - **Total Cost Range**: Given the optimizations and strategic funding, a reasonable upper estimate might be $0.20 to $0.30 per signature if we factor in all combined strategies effectively.\n  - **Total Cost Range**: $16 million to $24 million for 80 million signatures.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nUsing a combination of strategies can potentially keep the cost at the lower end of the spectrum while maximizing reach and engagement. The key to this approach is leveraging the strengths of each strategy while managing costs effectively, particularly by using the crypto token sale to fund more expensive efforts like targeted advertising and influencer partnerships. This holistic strategy could significantly reduce the overall cost per signature while still achieving the ambitious goal of 80 million signatures.\n"

    "description": "Exploring the logical reasoning behind reallocating 1% of military spending to medical research through international cooperation and decentralized funding.",
    "featuredImage": "/globalSolutions/1-percent-treaty/logical-proof.jpg",
    "content": "# Logical Proof\n\nWhy it is logical for the nations and citizens of the world to sign the 1% Treaty and reallocate 1% of military spending to medical research each year:\n\n## Axioms:\n1. Reducing death and suffering is a worthy goal.\n2. War increases death and suffering.\n3. Medical research reduces death and suffering.\n4. Resources spent on war cannot be spent on medical research.\n5. Countries act in their self-interest.\n\n## Premises:\n1. The world has finite resources.\n2. Resources spent on war are 20 times greater than resources spent on medical research.[^1]\n3. AI technology developed for warfare could lead to catastrophic outcomes like a Skynet scenario.[^2]\n4. People generally prefer resources to be used for medical research over warfare.[^3]\n5. No individual country can unilaterally reallocate war resources to medical research without risking attack from other countries.\n6. Defense companies globally spend between $200 million and $300 million annually on lobbying efforts.[^4]\n7. Military contractors globally receive between $800 billion to $1 trillion annually from government contracts.[^5]\n8. The world currently has 13,000 nuclear weapons, enough to cause between 13 and 130 \"extinction-level events\" when accounting for nuclear winter effects.[^6]\n9. Lobbyists are motivated by financial incentives and will work for the highest bidder.[^7]\n\n## Propositions:\n1. An international treaty where all countries allocate 1% of military budgets to medical research would maintain the balance of power while increasing resources for medical research.\n2. Reducing military budgets by 1% and allocating that to medical research would increase net national security by reducing the risk of AI-driven catastrophe.\n3. Using a decentralized crowdfunding platform, such as a blockchain-based system, to allocate medical research funds would be more transparent, efficient, and resistant to corruption compared to centralized government allocation.[^8]\n4. Robust auditing and verification mechanisms, such as satellite monitoring and on-site inspections, can ensure countries comply with the treaty.[^9]\n5. Implementing the 1% Treaty could yield $1.2 million in benefits per capita globally over 80 years.[^10]\n6. Creating a DAO to crowdfund $40M, spend $20M on lobbying and $20M on marketing for petition signatures from 1% of the population could get the 1% Treaty adopted.\n7. If the plan succeeds, the DAO would get $20B/year, enough to repay initial contributors with 0.5% of first year funds.\n8. The DAO could attempt to outbid defense contractors to hire their best lobbyists, potentially reducing their lobbying capacity by 50% and increasing the DAO's lobbying power by 100%.[^11]\n9. To ensure sufficient funding to out-lobby the military-industrial complex, contributors must be compensated at a rate of at least 10% annually, which is higher than the average return of the S&P 500.[^12]\n\n## Counterarguments:\n1. Global coordination on the 1% Treaty may be challenging due to differing national interests and priorities. However, the potential benefits of the Treaty, such as reduced catastrophic risks and increased medical research, provide a strong incentive for countries to cooperate.\n2. Some countries may attempt to cheat on the agreement by not fully reallocating 1% of their military budgets. However, the proposed auditing and verification mechanisms, such as satellite monitoring and on-site inspections, would help detect and deter cheating.\n3. The military-industrial complex may oppose the 1% Treaty due to the potential loss of funding. However, by outbidding defense contractors for their top lobbyists, the DAO can gain a lobbying advantage and counteract their opposition.\n\n## Proof:\n1. Resources spent on war cannot be spent on medical research. (Axiom 4)\n2. Resources spent on war are 20 times the resources spent on medical research. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, reallocating some resources from war to medical research would increase resources for medical research. (From 1 and 2)\n4. An international treaty for all countries to reallocate resources maintains the balance of power. (Proposition 1)\n5. Therefore, an international 1% treaty would increase resources for medical research while maintaining geopolitical stability. (From 3 and 4)\n6. AI weapons could lead to catastrophic Skynet-like scenarios. (Premise 3)\n7. Reducing AI weapons development reduces catastrophic risk. (From 6)\n8. The 1% treaty reduces resources for weapons, including AI weapons. (From Proposition 1)\n9. Therefore, the 1% treaty reduces catastrophic AI risk, increasing net security. (From 7 and 8, Proposition 2)\n10. Current nuclear arsenals can cause up to 130 extinction events. (Premise 8)\n11. Even if some military spending is warranted, we don't need the ability to exterminate humanity more than once. (From 10)\n12. Therefore, safely reducing military budgets, such as through the 1% Treaty, is reasonable. (From 11)\n13. Decentralized crowdfunding through a blockchain-based platform is more transparent, efficient, and resistant to corruption than centralized allocation. (Proposition 3)\n14. Therefore, decentralized crowdfunding for the 1% medical research fund is optimal. (From 5 and 13)\n15. Auditing and verification mechanisms, such as satellite monitoring and on-site inspections, ensure compliance. (Proposition 4)\n16. Therefore, the 1% Treaty is executable in a verifiable way. (From 5 and 15)\n17. The 1% Treaty could yield $1.2 million per person in global benefits. (Proposition 5)\n18. Therefore, the 1% Treaty provides significant net benefits to humanity. (From 17)\n19. Reducing death and suffering is a worthy goal. (Axiom 1)\n20. Medical research reduces death and suffering. (Axiom 3)\n21. The 1% Treaty increases medical research. (From 5)\n22. Therefore, the 1% Treaty reduces death and suffering. (From 19, 20, 21)\n23. Defense companies' lobbying ROI ranges from 333,233% to 399,900%. (From Premises 6, 7)\n24. Therefore, $20M in lobbying could secure $20B/year for the DAO based on typical lobbying returns. (From 23, Proposition 6)\n25. 1% of the population signing a petition has historically been sufficient for legislative adoption. (Premise 8)\n26. $20M in marketing could get 1% to sign based on typical customer acquisition costs. (Premise 8, Proposition 6)\n27. Therefore, $40M should be sufficient to get the 1% Treaty adopted. (From 24, 25, 26)\n28. The DAO crowdfunding model has proven capable of quickly raising tens of millions. (Proposition 6)\n29. Therefore, crowdfunding $40M for the plan is feasible. (From 28)\n30. If the plan succeeds, the DAO would get $20B/year, far exceeding initial costs. (Proposition 7)\n31. Therefore, initial contributors could be compensated if needed. (From 30)\n32. Lobbyists are motivated by financial incentives and will work for the highest bidder. (Premise 9)\n33. The DAO could attempt to outbid defense contractors to hire their best lobbyists. (From 32, Proposition 8)\n34. Hiring defense contractors' lobbyists could reduce their lobbying capacity by 50% and increase the DAO's by 100%. (Proposition 8)\n35. Therefore, the DAO could gain a significant lobbying advantage over defense contractors. (From 33, 34)\n36. Contributors must be compensated at a rate greater than 10% annually to exceed returns from alternative investments like the S&P 500. (Proposition 9)\n37. Sufficient compensation will ensure funding to out-lobby the military-industrial complex. (From 36)\n38. Therefore, the DAO must offer returns greater than 10% to attract necessary funding. (From 37)\n\n## Conclusion:\nThe 1% Treaty, which reallocates a portion of military spending to medical research in a stable, decentralized, and verifiable way, would reduce catastrophic risks, increase resources for beneficial research, and yield significant humanitarian benefits. Given the exorbitant destructive capacity of current nuclear arsenals, safely reducing military budgets through agreements like the 1% Treaty is a reasonable goal.\n\nThe plan to create a DAO, crowdfund $40 million, and lobby for the international 1% Treaty is logically sound and feasible based on the proven effectiveness of lobbying and the potential for crowdfunding. By outbidding defense contractors for their top lobbyists, the DAO could potentially reduce their lobbying capacity by 50% and increase its own by 100%, gaining a significant lobbying advantage. To attract the necessary funding to out-lobby the military-industrial complex, the DAO must offer annual returns greater than 10%, exceeding alternative investments like the S&P 500.\n\nAlthough implementing the 1% Treaty may face challenges such as global coordination difficulties and potential cheating by countries, the proposed auditing and verification mechanisms, along with the significant potential benefits, provide strong incentives for cooperation and compliance.\n\nThe Treaty would maintain geopolitical stability while massively increasing medical research, reducing catastrophic risks, and generating immense economic value. Given the feasibility, low initial funding requirements, and extraordinary potential benefits, this plan should be seriously considered.\n\n\n[^1]: World Bank. (2021).

    "featuredImage": "/globalSolutions/1-percent-treaty/paths.jpg",
    "content": "# Choose Your Path\n\nThe PATH Treaty stands at a critical juncture in human history, offering a stark choice between two futures: one path veers towards a precipice of destruction, fueled by an arms race of increasingly powerful artificial intelligence (AI) systems designed for warfare; the other leads to a horizon bright with the promise of health, longevity, and global well-being. The former is not just a continuation of the status quo—it's an acceleration towards potential human extinction.\n\n### The Inevitable Trajectory of Autonomous Warfare\n\nAs nations pour trillions into military budgets, a significant portion is dedicated to developing autonomous weapons, or \"slaughterbots,\" with AI optimized for a single, grim objective: maximizing the death and destruction of perceived enemies. This pursuit, left unchecked, risks spiraling out of control for several reasons:\n\n- **Autonomous Arms Race**: Countries locked in an escalating competition to create more efficient killing machines risk a future where wars are fought by AI, with decisions of life and death made in milliseconds, beyond human oversight.\n- **Objective Function Dystopia**: Programming AI with the goal of maximizing enemy casualties without moral or ethical considerations could lead to unforeseen consequences, including strategies that do not discriminate between combatants and non-combatants.\n- **Existential Threat**: The culmination of this trajectory is a world where AI-driven warfare technologies could, either by design or accident, lead to scenarios of mass destruction, potentially even human extinction. Without humans to stop them, the world might only be left with the very machines created for war.\n\n### The LOGICAL Treaty: A Path to Preservation\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the LOGICAL Treaty proposes a radical but necessary redirection of resources:\n\n#### The Current Spendings\n- **Global Military Expenditure**: Over $2 trillion a year, with an increasing focus on autonomous warfare capabilities.\n\n#### The Proposal\n- **Reallocate 1% of Military Budgets**: A seemingly small shift with profound implications, funneling resources into AI-driven health research instead of destructive technologies.\n\n#### The Impact\n- **Health and Longevity**: Accelerating the fight against chronic diseases, improving global health, and extending human lifespans.\n- **Averting Catastrophe**: Every dollar redirected is a step away from the brink of AI-driven warfare and towards a future where technology serves humanity's best interests.\n\n### Implementation through Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)\n\n1. **Global Collaboration**: Nations commit to investing in health over warfare, contributing to a shared fund managed by DIH.\n2. **AI for Good**: Leveraging AI's potential to revolutionize medical research, from data analysis to clinical trials, focusing on solving health crises rather than creating conflict.\n3. **Democratic Funding**: Ensuring the fair distribution of resources through community-driven decision-making, prioritizing projects with global health impact.\n4. **Open Innovation**: Sharing research findings openly, fostering a culture of collaboration and rapid advancement in health sciences.\n5. **Sustainable Peace**: By investing in health research, nations also invest in the stability and well-being of their citizens, contributing to a more peaceful world.\n\n### Conclusion: Choosing Our Future\n\nThe PATH Treaty is not just a policy proposal—it's a moral imperative. It calls for a collective reevaluation of our trajectory as a species, urging a shift from investing in technologies of death to those that promise life. By reallocating a fraction of military budgets towards health research, humanity can choose a future defined not by our capacity for destruction but by our commitment to preservation and improvement of life on Earth. This choice is ours to make.\n"

Assuming 50 working weeks per year, that's around 2,000 hours per year.\n- AGI AI scientists could potentially work 24/7/365, which equates to 8,760 hours per year.\n- Efficiency gain: 8,760 / 2,000 = 4.38 times more working hours.\n\n## 2. Knowledge sharing and access:\n\n- Human scientists often work in silos, with limited real-time access to the knowledge and insights of their peers. They rely on published papers, conferences, and personal networks to stay informed.\n- AGI AI scientists could have instant, comprehensive access to the knowledge and experiences of all other AI scientists, allowing them to build on each other's work seamlessly.\n- Efficiency gain: Estimating conservatively, let's say this instant knowledge sharing doubles the effective output per working hour.\n\n## 3. Eliminating redundant work:\n\n- Human scientists often duplicate efforts by exploring the same dead ends, as failed experiments are rarely published.\n- AGI AI scientists could share all experimental results, including failures, allowing them to collectively learn and avoid redundant work.\n- Efficiency gain: Let's conservatively estimate that eliminating redundant work could increase effective output by another 50%.\n\n## 4. Cognitive efficiency:\n\n- Human scientists are subject to cognitive limitations, biases, and distractions that can impede their problem-solving efficiency.\n- AGI AI scientists could potentially operate at peak cognitive performance consistently, optimizing their thought processes for maximum insight and productivity.\n- Efficiency gain: Assuming AGI AI scientists are twice as cognitively efficient as humans on average.\n\n## 5. Experimental iteration speed:\n\n- Human scientists are limited by physical constraints in how quickly they can set up, run, and analyze experiments.\n- AGI AI scientists could potentially run simulated experiments and analyze data at a much faster pace, allowing for more rapid iteration and learning.\n- Efficiency gain: Estimating that AGI AI scientists could iterate on experiments 10 times faster than human scientists.\n\n## Putting it all together:\n\n- Baseline human scientist annual output: 1\n- AGI AI scientist annual output:\n  - Working hours: 1 * 4.38 = 4.38\n  - Knowledge sharing: 4.38 * 2 = 8.76\n  - Eliminating redundancy: 8.76 * 1.5 = 13.14\n  - Cognitive efficiency: 13.14 * 2 = 26.28\n  - Experimental iteration: 26.28 * 10 = 262.8\n\nTherefore, based on these assumptions and estimates,\nAI scientists could potentially achieve 260 years of medical progress in a single year.\n\n\n\n# Examples\n\nThe integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in drug discovery and development is reshaping the pharmaceutical industry, offering unprecedented speed and efficiency in bringing new treatments to market. Here are some of the trailblazing companies that are at the forefront of this revolution.\n\n## Insilico Medicine: Pioneering AI-Driven Drug Discovery\n\nInsilico Medicine has made significant strides with its Pharma.AI platform, which employs deep learning algorithms to discover new drug targets and generate novel drug candidates.

    "content": "### Military Spending vs. Health Research: A Brain Drain\n\nWhen we talk about where our money goes, especially the big budgets like what's spent on the military, it's like choosing between two futures. One future focuses on weapons and wars, which can lead to destruction and loss of lives. The other invests in health research, aiming to cure diseases and help us live longer, healthier lives.\n\n### The Competition in Health Research\n\nImagine you're passionate about helping people live longer, so you start a nonprofit focused on longevity, which means studying how we can extend our healthy years. You're not alone; many groups share your mission. But here's the catch:\n\n- **Scarce Funding**: There's only so much money to go around for health research. Every new group that pops up is competing for the same limited pot of funds.\n- **The Funding Pie**: Think of funding as a pie. Starting another longevity nonprofit or company doesn't make the pie bigger; it just divides it into more, smaller pieces.\n- **Efficiency Questions**: If you manage to get funding, how do you know your group will use it better than another group might have?\n\n### Increasing the Funding Pie\n\nSo, how do we make the pie bigger instead of just slicing it thinner? The answer lies in looking at where a huge chunk of our collective budget goes: military spending.\n\n- **Shifting Resources**: By [reallocating even a small fraction](globalSolutions/1-percent-treaty/1-percent-treaty.md1-percent-treaty/1-percent-treaty.md) of the money spent on the military to health research, we can significantly increase the funds available for medical breakthroughs.\n- **From Destructive to Constructive**: Military budgets are massive globally. This spending is at the expense of constructive areas like health research. By shifting some of those funds, we're moving from investing in means of destruction to investing in life-saving research.\n\n### Conclusion: A Choice Between Futures\n\nThe decision to reallocate funds from military spending to health research is essentially a choice between two paths. One path takes us to a world populated by the remaining slaughterbots after all humans have been destroyed, while the other invests in our collective well-being and future health. It's about prioritizing life and longevity over destruction. This isn't just about making more money available for health research; it's about choosing a future where we value improving and saving lives more than the capacity to destroy them.\n"

    "content": "\n\n**Goal**: Optimally allocate scarce resources such that they maximize median health and happiness. \n\n# Abstract Approach:\nUse collective AI and human intelligence to:\n1. generate a list of actions humans or AI agents could take to achieve the goal.\n2. prioritize the list of actions based on their expected impact on the goal\n3. allocate resources to the human or AI agents that are most likely to succeed in implementing the actions at the lowest cost.\n4. monitor the results of the actions and adjust the list of actions and resource allocation as needed\n5. repeat steps 1-4 until the goal is achieved.\n\n# Concrete Approach:\n1. Create a website where people (Wishers) can submit an action that would most cost-effectively increase median health and happiness\n2. Show the Wishers two random wishes at a time and ask them to vote for the one that would most cost-effectively increase median health and happiness (binary choice or maybe with a slider)\n3. Aggregate the vote results of the pairwise comparisons to rank the ideas by their expected increase in median health and happiness\n4. Allow people (Genies) to propose an action they can take that will contribute to the fulfillment of the highest-ranked wish\n5. Show people 2 proposed actions at a time and ask them to choose the one that is most likely to succeed at the lowest cost\n6. Aggregate the results of the pairwise comparisons to rank the proposed actions by their expected success at the lowest cost\n\nExample Wish: I wish all the governments of the world would sign a treaty\nto redirect 1% of spending on war to a democratic platform to fund cures for diseases.\nExample Action: I will write a letter to the president of the United States asking him to sign the treaty.\n\n\n**How Wishocracy Works**\n========================\n\nWishocracy is a unique platform that uses the power of collective intelligence to identify and prioritize the most important wishes for society. It then allocates resources to the most promising solutions using a novel approach called Aggregated Pairwise Preference Allocation.\n\n**Discovering the Most Impactful Wishes**\n=========================================\n\nWishocracy allows people to submit wishes they believe would have the greatest positive impact on the world. Through a process of voting and discussion, the community collectively determines which wishes are the most important to focus on.\n\n**GenieDAOs: Teams United by a Common Wish**\n============================================\n\nGenieDAOs are special teams formed within Wishocracy where people with shared passions and skills come together to work on a specific wish. These teams collaborate to develop innovative solutions and strategies to make their chosen wish a reality.\n\n**WishTokens: Funding Solutions through Proposals**\n===================================================\n\nGenieDAOs can submit detailed proposals outlining their plans to fulfill a wish. The community then votes on these proposals using WishTokens, a unique funding mechanism. The proposals with the most votes receive the necessary resources to implement their solutions.\n\n**Aggregated Pairwise Preference Allocation: Making Decisions through Comparisons**\n========================================================\n\nWishocracy uses a novel voting system called Aggregated Pairwise Preference Allocation to make decisions. Instead of voting on many options at once, people are presented with pairs of wishes or proposals and asked to choose the one they prefer. This process is repeated many times, and the results are used to determine which wishes and proposals are the most popular and should be prioritized.\n"
