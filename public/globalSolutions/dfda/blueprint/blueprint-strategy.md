# Strategy for a World Without Disease

1. Collect Data on What Works Best:  
   Build a simple, trusted global database that shows which treatments and habits improve health the most. Make it easy for anyone—patient or researcher—to add info. Show clear rankings of treatments, so people know what actually helps.

2. Let People Choose:  
   Patients see the best treatments, order them easily, and report back their results. This feedback keeps improving the data and rankings. If a drug or diet works, it rises to the top. If it’s useless, it sinks.

3. Reward Disease Prevention and Cures:  
   Right now, companies make money from long-term illness. Change that. Give them part of the savings when they cure or prevent diseases. If a new therapy cuts healthcare costs, share the money saved with those who developed it. This makes cures profitable.

4. Involve Everyone:  
   Ask citizens, patients, doctors, and researchers worldwide to refine a simple public “Act” that aims at lower disease rates and better treatments. They vote on it or pressure their lawmakers to adopt it. As it’s improved, everyone understands where we’re headed and why.

5. Fund It Openly and Fairly:  
   Instead of traditional lobbying behind closed doors, gather support and funding from those who benefit: large employers, insurers (or better, self-insured ones), and even health-conscious citizens. Show them that by paying into this system—just a fraction of what they’d waste on sickness—they get healthier people and lower long-term costs.

**In short:**  
Collect honest data, let patients pick the best care, pay for prevention, invite everyone to shape the rules, and fund it openly. No tricks, no complexity: just find what works, share it, make cures profitable, and get governments and payers on board.
