Here’s a clearer, more intuitive framework:

**Phase 1: Define the Ideal**  
- **Blueprint for a World Without Disease:** A clear, accessible vision of what a disease-free society would look like. This document paints the target state in simple terms, so everyone knows what we’re aiming for.

**Phase 2: Chart the Path**  
- **Roadmap to a World Without Disease:** A practical, step-by-step plan that details the methods, tools, policies, and incentives to reach the goal. This shows exactly how we move from today’s reality to the envisioned future.

**Phase 3: Seek Global Consent**  
- **Global Referendum on Disease Eradication:** Put the plan to a worldwide vote. Give every citizen a voice to accept or reject the proposed changes. If the global community says “yes,” it grants both moral and political authority to move forward.

**Phase 4: Enact the Legal Framework**  
- **Disease Eradication Act:** With broad support, pass a law that formalizes the reforms, incentives, and institutions necessary to implement the roadmap. This locks in the structure needed to coordinate efforts, fund research, and reward prevention and cures.

**Phase 5: Implement, Measure, and Adapt**  
- **Building the World Without Disease:** Begin large-scale deployment of prevention strategies, cutting-edge treatments, and data-driven policies. Monitor progress, refine approaches based on real-world data, and continually improve systems until disease is effectively eliminated or minimized.

This progression—Vision (Blueprint), Plan (Roadmap), Consent (Referendum), Authority (Act), and Action (Implementation)—creates a logical, transparent sequence from conception to worldwide realization. It’s easy to understand and aligns with common-sense steps: imagine a better future, figure out how to get there, ask everyone if they agree, make it official, then carry it out and keep improving.
