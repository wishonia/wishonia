## Reduced Suffering

To estimate the total Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) lost every year currently, we need to consider various factors that contribute to the global burden of disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) provide data on global health that can help us make this estimate.

Let's break this down:

1\. Global Burden of Disease:  
The IHME's Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study is one of the most comprehensive efforts to quantify health loss. They use a metric called Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), which is similar to QALYs but measures health loss rather than health gain.

According to the GBD 2019 study:  
\- Global DALYs lost in 2019: approximately 2.44 billion

2\. Converting DALYs to QALYs:  
DALYs and QALYs are conceptually similar but inversely related. We can roughly equate 1 DALY lost to 1 QALY not gained.

3\. Premature Deaths:  
\- Global deaths in 2019: about 58 million  
\- Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature death: approximately 1.47 billion

4\. Years Lived with Disability (YLD):  
YLD represents the years lived in less than ideal health.  
\- Global YLDs in 2019: approximately 0.97 billion

5\. Calculation:  
Total QALYs lost ≈ Total DALYs \= YLL \+ YLD  
≈ 1.47 billion \+ 0.97 billion  
≈ 2.44 billion QALYs

Therefore, we can estimate that approximately 2.44 billion QALYs are lost globally each year due to premature death and disability.

In the context of the decentralized FDA initiative, this 2.44 billion QALYs lost annually represents the potential "market" for health improvements. Even a small percentage reduction in this number due to accelerated and more numerous drug developments could result in millions of QALYs gained, translating to substantial improvements in global health and wellbeing.

### Monetary Value of Reduced Suffering

Certainly. Let's break down the estimate for lives saved and improved in more detail. We'll start with our previous estimate and then analyze it more thoroughly.

Original Estimate: Current system: 13 drugs \* 100,000 lives \= 1.3 million lives improved/saved New system: 392 drugs \* 100,000 lives \= 39.2 million lives improved/saved

Now, let's break this down more precisely:

1. Types of Impact: a) Lives Saved: Complete prevention of death b) Lives Significantly Improved: Major improvement in quality of life c) Lives Moderately Improved: Noticeable improvement in quality of life  
     
2. Varied Impact by Drug Type: Not all drugs have the same impact. Let's categorize: a) High Impact: e.g., cancer treatments, heart disease medications b) Medium Impact: e.g., chronic disease management drugs c) Low Impact: e.g., minor symptom relief medications  
     
3. Global vs. Local Impact: Some drugs might have a global reach, while others might be more localized.  
     
4. Time Frame of Impact: Consider both immediate and long-term effects.

Detailed Breakdown:

Assuming 392 new drugs per year in the new system:

| Impact Category | Percentage of Drugs | Number of Drugs | Lives Affected per Drug | Total Lives Affected |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| High Impact | 20% | 78 | 200,000 | 15,600,000 |
| Medium Impact | 50% | 196 | 100,000 | 19,600,000 |
| Low Impact | 30% | 118 | 50,000 | 5,900,000 |
| Total | 100% | 392 | \- | 41,100,000 |

Now, let's break down the type of impact:

| Impact Type | Percentage | Number of Lives |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Lives Saved | 10% | 4,110,000 |
| Lives Significantly Improved | 30% | 12,330,000 |
| Lives Moderately Improved | 60% | 24,660,000 |
| Total | 100% | 41,100,000 |

Additional Considerations:

1. Cumulative Effect: The impact of these drugs would accumulate over time. If we consider a 10-year period: Lives affected over 10 years: 41,100,000 \* 10 \= 411,000,000  
     
2. Indirect Benefits:  
     
   - Family members and caregivers benefiting from improved health of patients  
   - Reduced burden on healthcare systems allowing better care for others  
   - Economic benefits from increased productivity of healthier individuals

   

   Estimate: For every life directly affected, 2 additional lives indirectly benefit Indirect benefits: 41,100,000 \* 2 \= 82,200,000 per year

   

3. Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs): Let's estimate the QALY impact:  
     
   - Lives Saved: Assume average of 10 additional years at 0.8 quality  
   - Lives Significantly Improved: Assume 0.3 QALY improvement for 10 years  
   - Lives Moderately Improved: Assume 0.1 QALY improvement for 10 years

   

   QALY Calculation:

   

   - Lives Saved: 4,110,000 \* 10 \* 0.8 \= 32,880,000 QALYs  
   - Lives Significantly Improved: 12,330,000 \* 10 \* 0.3 \= 36,990,000 QALYs  
   - Lives Moderately Improved: 24,660,000 \* 10 \* 0.1 \= 24,660,000 QALYs Total QALYs gained per year: 94,530,000

   

4. Economic Value: Using a conservative value of $50,000 per QALY: 94,530,000 QALYs \* $50,000 \= $4.73 trillion per year

Summary:

- Direct lives affected annually: 41,100,000  
- Indirect lives affected annually: 82,200,000  
- Total lives affected annually: 123,300,000  
- QALYs gained annually: 94,530,000  
- Economic value: $4.73 trillion per year

This detailed breakdown provides a more nuanced view of the potential impact, considering different types and levels of benefit. The total economic value is even higher than our initial estimate, largely due to the consideration of QALYs and the cumulative effect over time. However, it's important to note that these are still estimates and actual results could vary based on the specific drugs developed and their real-world impact.
