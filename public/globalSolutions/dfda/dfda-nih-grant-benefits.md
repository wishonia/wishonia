## NIH Grant Efficiency Increases

The typical size of a National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trial research grant varies depending on the phase and scope of the trial. However, estimates suggest that grants often range between **$500,000 to several million dollars** annually per project. For multi-year studies, this can easily reach **$3M to $5M** or more per trial. The NIH spends billions annually on these research grants, which often include costs for setting up trial sites, patient recruitment, data management, and administrative overhead.

Potential Cost Reduction:

1. **Economies of Scale:** By centralizing trial management and removing duplication of effort (e.g., setting up sites and recruiting patients repeatedly), costs could be reduced significantly. If 30 trials are run for the cost of 1 (as in the earlier model), the NIH could test vastly more treatments for the same budget.  
2. **Automation and Efficiency:** With an automated, decentralized trial platform, administrative, recruitment, monitoring, and data analysis costs could be slashed. Trials would use AI for patient matching, automated data collection, and blockchain for secure data handling.

Example Grant Savings:

* **Typical NIH Grant**: $2M \- $5M per trial.  
* **Reduced Grant Cost** (using decentralized AI system): **$100,000 to $500,000**. This would include essential costs like patient incentives, drug production, and minimal administrative oversight.

The financial model shows that with the current NIH spending of $15 billion annually, approximately 6,000 trials are funded under the traditional system with an average grant of $2.5 million per trial. By reducing the trial cost to $500,000 through a decentralized AI system, NIH could potentially fund **30,000 trials annually**â€”a fivefold increase in the number of trials, significantly accelerating medical research and the discovery of new treatments.
