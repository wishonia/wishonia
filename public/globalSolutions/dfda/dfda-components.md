# Key Components

1. Relational Database Schema  
   * Store all data required for FDA-recognized Clinical Trials  
   * Include ongoing time series data of interventions, symptoms, and biomarkers  
   * Store study protocols  
2. OAuth Integration  
   * Allow other digital health platforms, apps, or decentralized Clinical Trial platforms to register  
   * Enable users to share their data from the dFDA database  
   * Allow apps to store data for users in the dFDA database  
3. API and Documentation  
   * Documented with OpenAPI specification  
   * Provide interactive documentation  
4. Decentralized Identity Provider  
   * Act as an identity provider for the system  
5. Developer Portal  
   * Allow registration of applications or devices  
   * Provide Client ID and secret for authentication  
6. Software Development Kits (SDKs)  
   * Generate SDKs in multiple languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.)  
   * Facilitate easy integration with existing applications  
   * Use Auth0 SDKs as inspiration  
7. Study Creation and Management  
   * Allow scientists to log in, select predictors and outcomes, and create studies  
   * Identify existing studies for the same factors and outcomes  
   * Add Principal Investigators as co-authors when appropriate  
   * Generate referral URLs for participant recruitment  
   * Create study protocols using AI, ensuring FDA compliance  
   * Include meta-analysis of existing research from sources like ClinicalTrials.gov  
   * List all possible risks for informed consent  
   * Notify existing Principal Investigators about new related studies  
8. Intervention Sourcing and Tracking  
   * List all potential sources for interventions (supplements, OTC, medications)  
   * Provide telehealth scheduling for prescription medications  
   * Identify global manufacturers of medications  
   * Track intervention sources to identify counterfeits or contamination  
   * Implement ongoing, automated pharmacovigilance  
9. Data Analysis and Decision Making  
   * Provide patients with a ranked list of the most effective interventions for their condition based on AI generated meta-analyses of data stored in the platform and all available research and other data-sources  
   * Conduct thorough cost-benefit analysis for every intervention and condition  
   * Use AI models to produce safety and efficacy profiles  
   * Calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and potential benefits  
   * Implement predefined algorithmic system for determining net benefit or harm  
10. Open Source and Collaboration  
    * Ensure all code is open source to encourage contributions and improvements
