## Other User Stories

The pharmaceutical company representative and the patient are the primary users of this decentralized clinical trial system. They cover the most critical aspects of the clinical trial process from both the sponsor and participant perspectives. However, we might want to consider a few additional personas that could interact with the system:

1. Healthcare Provider: A doctor or nurse who might recommend trials to their patients or be involved in monitoring participants.  
2. Regulatory Reviewer: Someone from a regulatory body like the FDA who would review trial designs and results.  
3. Data Analyst/Researcher: A scientist who might access the anonymized data for meta-analyses or further research.  
4. System Administrator: Someone who maintains and updates the AI and infrastructure of the platform.

These additional personas could help ensure the system meets all necessary requirements and functions smoothly for all potential users. However, if we're focusing on the core functionality and primary use cases, the pharmaceutical company representative and the patient are indeed the most crucial personas to consider.
