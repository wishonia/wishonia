## ðŸ’¡ Solution: Decentralized Automated Clinical Trials

With a decentralized autonomous FDA, we can automate clinical trials, reducing the cost and time it takes to bring new drugs to market.

This could reduce the cost of clinical trials by [90% from $56 million to under $2.4 million](../cost-savings-from-decentralized-clinical-trials.md) per treatment.
