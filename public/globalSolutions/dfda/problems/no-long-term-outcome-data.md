# ðŸ—“ No Long-Term Outcome Data

Even if there is a financial incentive to research a new drug, there is no data on the long-term outcomes of the drug. The data collection period for participants can be as short as several months. Under the current system, it's not financially feasible to collect data on a participant for years or decades. So we have no idea if the long-term effects of a drug are worse than the initial benefits.

For instance, even after controlling for co-morbidities, the Journal of American Medicine recently found that long-term use of Benadryl and other anticholinergic medications is associated with an [increased](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2091745) risk for dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
