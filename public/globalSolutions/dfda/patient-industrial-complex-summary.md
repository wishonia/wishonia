**Goal:**
Cure all the things real fast in 2 easy steps!

**How To:**

1. **Create a Global Policy Blueprint**
   Collaboratively draft a *Blueprint for a World Without Disease* using a democratic wiki process like gov4git, bringing together experts, patients, and advocates.

   Key components include:
   - **Decentralized Autonomous Regulatory Framework**: Reduce trial costs by 95% (from $56M to $2M) through data aggregation and cost-benefit analysis. ([Learn More](https://dfda.earth))
   - **Patient Rights to Decentralized Participation**: Ensure all patients can join clinical trials by removing barriers like exclusion criteria, distance, or costs. Currently, only 3% of chronic disease patients participate.
   - **Incentivized Cures & Prevention**: Use the 50/50 Health Savings Sharing Program to reward manufacturers with proportional shares of long-term health savings. This incentivizes affordable cures and prevention by linking rewards to the number of people treated. Savings are tracked via the dFDA global treatment outcomes database.

2. **Test Global Support**
   Conduct a global referendum to see if the blueprint reflects the will of humanity. Historically, petitions with 1% global support have driven significant change. To achieve this, incentivize participation through referral links and rewards (e.g., tokens or minimal cash payments) for each vote cast via referral.

**Cost of 80 Million Votes**
- Large-scale campaigns typically spend $1-$5 per participant. Social media and token incentives can reduce costs to $0.50 per vote, achieving 80M votes for $40-$60 million.

For the first time in history, a DAO could enable mass coordination among millions of small donors and participants to overcome systemic imbalances. Together, we can make the *Blueprint for a World Without Disease* a reality.
