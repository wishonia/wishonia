# üèõÔ∏è Patient Industrial Complex Advocacy System

## üìú Overview

The Patient Industrial Complex (PIC) uses tokens to reward actions that advance
the [Cure Acceleration Act](https://wishonia.love/dfda/cure-acceleration-act) and reduce patient suffering. The token has no
intrinsic value - it's simply a point system to incentivize and coordinate collective action.

# **Goal**  
Cure all the things real fast in 2 easy steps! 

# **HOW TO**
## **Short Story:**
1. Create a collaboratively written global policy Blueprint for a World Without Disease.
2. Have a global referendum to see if it is the will of humanity.

## **Long Story**

### Step 1. **Draft Ideal Policy Through Collective Intelligence**:  

So the first step is to get some real smart people to tell us how to make a world without diseases.  This will go in a document using a democratic wiki process like 
gov4git. 

I think the initial draft would include:

- **Decentralized Autonomous Regulatory Framework**:  
Aggregate and analyze all the data, enabling quantitative treatment effectiveness rankings and algorithmic cost-benefit analysis of the safety and effectiveness of treatments while drastically reducing trial costs by 95% from $56M to $2M.  https://dfda.earth

- **Patient Rights to Decentralized Participation**:  
Guarantee patient access to clinical trials, removing artificial barriers and enabling patients to contribute to‚Äîand benefit from‚Äîglobal health research.  Currently, only 3% of chronic disease patients are able to participate in a given trial due to exclusion criteria, distance, costs, or other reasons. 

- **Incentivized Cures & Prevention**:  

Change the economic model so that curative and preventative treatments become more profitable than chronic disease management. The 50/50 Health Savings Sharing Program would reward manufacturers with a proportional share of the long-term health savings their treatments create. This incentivizes manufacturers to create cures and preventative stuff like gene therapies and epigenetic reprogramming.  Savings are determined through the dFDA global treatment outcomes database, which quantifies the real-world impact of each treatment.  The reward system incentivizes the manufacturers to make treatments affordable for everyone because the more people that take their treatment, the more money they get. 

### Step 2. **See If People Like The Idea**:  

OK. So we've got this super neat document with the recipe for utopia.  Who cares?  We gotta get lots of people with lots of power to do all that stuff.   That requires checking if everyone wants it or not.  Historically, petitions with at least 1% popular support have led to positive change. So we have to figure out how to get 1% of the population of each nation to vote on it. 

So we need lots of people to tell their friends to vote on it.  For some reason, most people won't do things unless you give them worthless pieces of paper with presidents on them.  What's even stranger is that they will do things for otherwise worthless pieces of paper with presidents on them.

So we give people referral links and then give them pieces of paper with presidents on them (or dog coins or something) for each person who votes via their referral link.  

## Cost to get 80M Votes
- Large-scale petitions or digital movements (e.g., political campaigns) typically spend $1-$5 per signatory or action in outreach, depending on the region and the cause.
- Viral or social media-driven efforts can dramatically reduce costs, potentially achieving $0.50 per participant if the message resonates strongly.

If the campaign starts small, scales gradually, and uses both token incentives and effective viral strategies, achieving 80 million votes could cost $40-$60 million (cash equivalent), with tokens minimizing upfront financial outlays.
