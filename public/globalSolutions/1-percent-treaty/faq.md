# FAQ

## Q: Why focus on reducing military spending? Shouldn't we just increase health research funding directly?

While increasing health research funding through any means is valuable, tying it to a small reduction in military spending serves several purposes. First, it provides a clear funding source that doesn't take away from other priorities. Second, it sparks a conversation about the opportunity costs of our current resource allocation and whether it aligns with our values. Third, it creates a mechanism for global cooperation and trust-building as nations take this step together. Finally, even a small shift from militarism to health sends a powerful signal about the world we want to build.

## Q: Is a 1% reduction in military budgets really enough to make a difference?

While 1% may seem small, it translates to around $20 billion per year globally - a transformative sum for health research. 

It's also important to remember that this is intended as a starting point, not an end goal. As countries experience the benefits of this reallocation, they may be inspired to go further. 

Even a 1% shift sets a crucial precedent and begins to normalize the idea of prioritizing health over warfare.

## Q: How can we ensure that countries actually follow through on their commitments?

The treaty should include robust auditing and verification mechanisms to hold countries accountable. This could involve regular reporting, independent inspections, and penalties for non-compliance. Blockchain technology could also create transparent, tamper-proof records of contributions. Ultimately, the treaty's power will come from the collective weight of global norms and diplomatic pressure as much as formal enforcement.

## Q: Won't reducing military strength make countries more vulnerable?

So there are two ways to increase national security:

1. Have an endless arms race where everyone keeps spending more and more on weapons.
2. All countries will be reducing their military budgets proportionally, so the balance of power remains unchanged. 
No country gains a military advantage. 

In fact,
the national security of everyone would be _**increased**_ because all their enemies would have 1% less bombs,
biological weapons, etc. to destroy them with.

## Q: How can we be sure the research funding will be spent effectively?

The proposal's decentralized, crowdsourced approach is designed to maximize impact.
By transparently allowing scientists, institutions, and the public to propose and vote on projects, it taps into collective wisdom and promotes accountability. 
Rigorous reporting on outcomes will also allow continuous improvement and ensure that funds flow to the most promising work.
While no system is perfect, this approach offers significant advantages over centralized, opaque allocation processes vulnerable to special interests.

## Q: Is it really possible to get a global treaty ratified in today's polarized geopolitical climate?

Admittedly, securing a global agreement is a daunting challenge.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a unique window of opportunity by highlighting our shared vulnerability and the importance of scientific cooperation.

With enough grassroots momentum and smart diplomacy,
leaders may find the political will to come together around this common cause.
The key is presenting the treaty not as an ideological stance,
but as an apolitical, practical solution that benefits everyone.

By starting with an achievable 1% target and demonstrating clear gains, we can build trust for more ambitious cooperation over time.

## Q: Don't we already spend a lot on medical research?

Even if your country is a leader in health research, a global effort will yield benefits that no nation can achieve alone.

Diseases don't respect borders, and breakthroughs in one part of the world can save lives everywhere.

By pooling resources and expertise on a global scale, we accelerate progress and ensure fair access to treatments. 

We also reduce the risk of devastating cross-border biological threats, enhancing everyone's security. Supporting this treaty is a recognition that, in our interconnected age, health is a global public good that requires collective action.
