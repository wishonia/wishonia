To estimate the cost of creating a DAO like [ConstitutionDAO](https://juicebox.money/p/constitutiondao)
to get initial funding, we need to consider the various expenses involved in setting up and running the DAO:

1. Smart Contract Development:
  - Developing the smart contracts for the DAO, including token creation, voting mechanisms, and treasury management.
  - Estimated cost: $50,000 - $200,000, depending on the complexity of the contracts and the experience of the developers.

2. Web Development:
  - Creating a user-friendly website for the DAO, including information about the project, token sales, and community engagement features.
  - Estimated cost: $20,000 - $100,000, depending on the features and design requirements.

3. Auditing and Security:
  - Conducting thorough audits of the smart contracts and website to ensure security and minimize vulnerabilities.
  - Estimated cost: $20,000 - $100,000, depending on the complexity of the system and the reputation of the auditing firm.

4. Legal and Compliance:
  - Obtaining legal advice to ensure the DAO structure and token offering comply with relevant regulations in different jurisdictions.
  - Estimated cost: $50,000 - $200,000, depending on the complexity of the legal issues and the jurisdictions involved.

5. Marketing and Community Building:
  - Promoting the DAO to attract contributors and build a strong community around the project.
  - Estimated cost: $50,000 - $500,000, depending on the scale of the marketing efforts and the channels used (e.g., social media, influencer partnerships, events).

6. Operational Expenses:
  - Ongoing costs for running the DAO, such as hosting, community management, and contributor support.
  - Estimated cost: $10,000 - $50,000 per month, depending on the size and activity of the community.

7. Contingency Fund:
  - Setting aside funds for unexpected expenses or challenges that may arise during the DAO's operation.
  - Estimated cost: 10-20% of the total budget.

Putting it all together:
- Smart Contract Development: $50,000 - $200,000
- Web Development: $20,000 - $100,000
- Auditing and Security: $20,000 - $100,000
- Legal and Compliance: $50,000 - $200,000
- Marketing and Community Building: $50,000 - $500,000
- Operational Expenses (6 months): $60,000 - $300,000
- Contingency Fund (15%): $37,500 - $210,000

Total Estimated Cost Range: $287,500 - $1,610,000

Therefore, based on these estimates, the cost of creating a DAO like ConstitutionDAO to get initial funding could range from around $300,000 to $1.6 million.
