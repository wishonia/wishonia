## Direct Military Spending

![military-spending-scenarios-chart.png](military-spending-scenarios-chart.png)

Global military spending nearly doubled from $1.1 trillion in 2000 to $1.9 trillion in 2020 (in 2020 inflation-adjusted dollars). This is an average increase of $3.9% or $42 billion a year.

## Direct Annual Costs of War:

1. **Military Expenditure: $1,981 billion.** This reflects the total global spending on armed forces, including salaries, operations, maintenance, and procurement of weapons and equipment.
2. **Economic Impact of Conflict: $521 billion.** Costs incurred due to the immediate effects of war, such as destruction of property, loss of life, and the displacement of people.
3. **Infrastructure Destruction: $1,875 billion.** Represents the cost to repair or replace infrastructure damaged or destroyed during conflicts, including roads, bridges, and utilities.
4. **Trade and Investment Disruption: $616 billion.** Estimated losses from interruptions in trade flows and deterred investments in conflict zones or areas under threat.

## Indirect Annual Costs of War:

1. **Human Costs: $1,000 billion (using statistical value of life).** Calculated by applying a monetary value to the loss of life, this figure represents the cost of human casualties of war.
2. **Opportunity Costs: Lost economic benefits from military spending.** Resources spent on military endeavors could have been used for other societal needs, such as education or healthcare.
3. **Multiplier Effect: Additional economic activity from productive investment.** Reflects the lost economic growth that could have been generated if resources were invested in productive sectors rather than military spending.
4. **Long-term Healthcare for Veterans: $200 billion.** Costs associated with providing ongoing medical care, rehabilitation, and support services to veterans injured during military service.
5. **Psychological Impacts on Populations: $100 billion.** Expenses related to treating mental health issues like PTSD, depression, and anxiety stemming from the trauma of war.
6. **Loss of Human Capital: $300 billion.** Economic impact of losing skilled and productive individuals to conflict, affecting the workforce and future earning potentials.
7. **Environmental Degradation: $100 billion.** Costs to address environmental damage caused by warfare, including land degradation, pollution, and loss of biodiversity.
8. **Refugee Support: $150 billion.** Expenses for providing assistance to refugees, including shelter, food, healthcare, and integration services.

## Calculations:

- **Human Cost of War:** `Annual Deaths × Statistical Value of Life`
- **Total Direct Costs:** `Military Expenditure + Economic Impact of Conflict + Infrastructure Destruction + Trade and Investment Disruption`
- **Total Indirect Costs:** `Human Costs + Long-term Healthcare for Veterans + Psychological Impacts on Populations + Loss of Human Capital + Environmental Degradation + Refugee Support`
- **Updated Total Annual Cost of War:** `Total Direct Costs + Total Indirect Costs`

### Total Annual Cost of War:

- **Direct Costs Total:** $4,993 billion.
- **Indirect Costs Total:** $2,245.25 billion.
- **Updated Total Annual Cost:** $7,238.25 billion.

### Total Cost to the Average Person Over Their Lifetime

Assuming a global population of 7.8 billion and an average lifespan of 80 years:

1. **Annual Per Capita Cost:** $7,238.25 billion / 7.8 billion = $928.24
2. **Lifetime Cost Per Person:** $928.24 × 80 years = $74,259.2

The comprehensive annual cost of war, factoring in both direct and indirect costs, is approximately $7,238.25 billion. This equates to $74,259.2 per person over an 80-year lifespan.
