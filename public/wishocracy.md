  How we can use collective intelligence to identify and prioritize the most
  important wishes for society and allocate resources to the most promising
  solutions.
---


**Goal**: Optimally allocate scarce resources such that they maximize median health and happiness. 

# Abstract Approach:
Use collective AI and human intelligence to:
1. generate a list of actions humans or AI agents could take to achieve the goal.
2. prioritize the list of actions based on their expected impact on the goal
3. allocate resources to the human or AI agents that are most likely to succeed in implementing the actions at the lowest cost.
4. monitor the results of the actions and adjust the list of actions and resource allocation as needed
5. repeat steps 1-4 until the goal is achieved.

# Concrete Approach:
1. Create a website where people (Wishers) can submit an action that would most cost-effectively increase median health and happiness
2. Show the Wishers two random wishes at a time and ask them to vote for the one that would most cost-effectively increase median health and happiness (binary choice or maybe with a slider)
3. Aggregate the vote results of the pairwise comparisons to rank the ideas by their expected increase in median health and happiness
4. Allow people (Genies) to propose an action they can take that will contribute to the fulfillment of the highest-ranked wish
5. Show people 2 proposed actions at a time and ask them to choose the one that is most likely to succeed at the lowest cost
6. Aggregate the results of the pairwise comparisons to rank the proposed actions by their expected success at the lowest cost

Example Wish: I wish all the governments of the world would sign a treaty
to redirect 1% of spending on war to a democratic platform to fund cures for diseases.
Example Action: I will write a letter to the president of the United States asking him to sign the treaty.


**How Wishocracy Works**
========================

Wishocracy is a unique platform that uses the power of collective intelligence to identify and prioritize the most important wishes for society. It then allocates resources to the most promising solutions using a novel approach called Aggregated Pairwise Preference Allocation.

**Discovering the Most Impactful Wishes**
=========================================

Wishocracy allows people to submit wishes they believe would have the greatest positive impact on the world. Through a process of voting and discussion, the community collectively determines which wishes are the most important to focus on.

**GenieDAOs: Teams United by a Common Wish**
============================================

GenieDAOs are special teams formed within Wishocracy where people with shared passions and skills come together to work on a specific wish. These teams collaborate to develop innovative solutions and strategies to make their chosen wish a reality.

**WishTokens: Funding Solutions through Proposals**
===================================================

GenieDAOs can submit detailed proposals outlining their plans to fulfill a wish. The community then votes on these proposals using WishTokens, a unique funding mechanism. The proposals with the most votes receive the necessary resources to implement their solutions.

**Aggregated Pairwise Preference Allocation: Making Decisions through Comparisons**
========================================================

Wishocracy uses a novel voting system called Aggregated Pairwise Preference Allocation to make decisions. Instead of voting on many options at once, people are presented with pairs of wishes or proposals and asked to choose the one they prefer. This process is repeated many times, and the results are used to determine which wishes and proposals are the most popular and should be prioritized.
