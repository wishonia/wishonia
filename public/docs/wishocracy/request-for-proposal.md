# Request for Proposal (RFP)

## Objectives

The global objectives of the Wishocracy project are to create a comprehensive, decentralized system that optimizes the allocation of societal resources to maximize the fulfillment of collective wishes and solve pressing global challenges. The key objectives include:

1. Efficient Resource Allocation: Develop a system that enables the most effective and efficient allocation of limited resources (financial, human, material) to address the most critical and high-impact wishes and problems.

2. Global Coordination: Facilitate seamless coordination and collaboration among individuals, organizations, and communities worldwide to minimize duplication of efforts, leverage collective intelligence, and achieve synergies in solving complex issues.

3. Collective Prioritization: Implement mechanisms, such as Aggregated Pairwise Preference Allocation (APPA), to capture and prioritize the collective preferences and wisdom of the global community in determining the most important wishes and problems to address.

4. Decentralized and Interoperable: Design a modular, decentralized architecture that enables interoperability and integration with existing systems, platforms, and solutions to maximize adoption, participation, and impact.

5. Transparency and Accountability: Ensure transparency in decision-making processes, resource allocation, and impact assessment, while maintaining accountability for outcomes and results.

6. Continuous Improvement: Foster a culture of iterative learning and adaptation by incorporating feedback loops, data-driven insights, and best practices to continuously refine and enhance the system's effectiveness over time.

7. Incentivized Participation: Develop incentive structures and reward mechanisms that encourage widespread participation, contributions, and high-quality work from diverse stakeholders.

8. Accessibility and Inclusivity: Ensure that the system is accessible, user-friendly, and inclusive to people from all backgrounds, geographies, and technical abilities, promoting equitable participation and representation.

9. Scalability and Resilience: Build a system that can scale effectively to accommodate the growing complexity and volume of global wishes and problems, while remaining resilient to disruptions, attacks, or failures.

10. Positive Global Impact: Ultimately, the overarching objective is to create a system that empowers humanity to effectively address the most pressing challenges, realize its collective potential, and create a more sustainable, equitable, and flourishing world for all.

By aligning the design, development, and implementation of the Wish Fulfillment System with these global objectives, Wishocracy aims to create a transformative platform for global cooperation and progress towards universally shared goals.

## Project Overview

Wishocracy seeks proposals for the design and development of a comprehensive, modular, and interoperable Wish Fulfillment System. The system should include detailed implementation of the following components:

1. Wish Management System
2. Budget Allocation System
3. Solution Management System
4. Task Management System
5. Wisher Relationship Management (WRM) System
6. Resource Management System
7. Impact Assessment System
8. Incentive and Reward System
9. Dispute Resolution System
10. Knowledge Management System
11. Integration and Interoperability Layer
12. User Experience and Interface Layer

The primary goals of this project are to:

- Minimize development costs by leveraging existing open-source solutions and technologies
- Maximize universal adoption through decentralized interoperability and seamless integration with existing systems and platforms

## Scope of Work

The selected vendor will be responsible for:

1. Conducting a comprehensive assessment of existing open-source solutions and technologies that can be leveraged for each component of the Wish Fulfillment System
2. Designing a modular architecture that allows for seamless integration of existing solutions and custom-built components
3. Developing custom components and modules where necessary to fill gaps in existing solutions
4. Ensuring interoperability and data exchange between all components and external systems through the use of open APIs, data standards, and protocols
5. Designing and implementing user-friendly interfaces and experiences across various platforms and devices
6. Testing and validating the integrated system to ensure functionality, performance, and security
7. Providing documentation, training, and support for the deployment, operation, and maintenance of the system

## Proposal Requirements
