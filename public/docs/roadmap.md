# Roadmap to Optimal Resource Allocation

## Milestones
1. [Self-Improving GitHub Repository](#1-self-improving-github-repository)
2. [Digital Twin Safe](roadmap/digital-twin-safe/README.md)
3. [Positron Nodes and Network](roadmap/positron-network/roadmap.md)
4. [Wishonia](roadmap/wishonian-government/wishonian-government.md)

## 1. Self-Improving GitHub Repository

Wishocracy is meant to be an AI-powered,
decentralized project management system
for most efficiently achieving humanity's goals
by optimizing the allocation of resources and the coordination of efforts.
So we may as well start by building autonomous agents to build the system itself.

So we'll need a project manager agent that takes in a product requirements document
and manages the project from start to finish.
It will then be responsible for creating issues, assigning tasks, and tracking progress.
Specialized coding agents will be responsible for reading the GitHub issues that have been assigned to them, writing the code, and submitting pull requests.

1. **Modular Approach**: It's generally easier to start with focused, modular agents that handle specific tasks before attempting to build a fully autonomous, self-improving system. 

2. **Agent Architecture**: We'll need to define the architecture for these agents, including how they interact with each other, how they access and update the codebase, and how they prioritize and coordinate their efforts. This could involve techniques like blackboard systems, multi-agent systems, or other approaches from the field of distributed artificial intelligence.

3. **Agent Capabilities**: Each agent will need to have specialized capabilities relevant to its role. For example, the test agent will need to be able to interact with browsers and APIs, the project manager agent will need to be able to break down requirements and estimate costs/values, and the coding style agent will need to understand coding conventions and be able to refactor code.
