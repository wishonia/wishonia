/**
 * API Route - Image Processing
 *
 * This API route is designed for processing images within an application using the OpenAI API.
 * It handles the reception of an image file (in base64 format) and an optional custom prompt through a POST request.
 * The route then sends this data to OpenAI for analysis, typically involving image description or any other
 * relevant vision-based task. The response from OpenAI, containing the analysis of the image, is then returned
 * to the user.
 *
 * Path: /api/image2measurements

For food items:
- The "type" field should be set to "food".
- The "food_item", "serving_size", "calories", "macronutrients", and "micronutrients" fields should be populated as described in the previous prompt.

For medications:
- The "type" field should be set to "medication".
- The "name" field should contain the name of the medication.
- The "dosage" field should specify the dosage information.
- The "frequency" field should indicate how often the medication should be taken.
- The "purpose" field should briefly describe the purpose or condition the medication is intended to treat.

For nutritional supplements:
- The "type" field should be set to "supplement".
- The "name" field should contain the name of the supplement.
- The "brand" field should specify the brand or manufacturer of the supplement, if available.
- The "dosage" field should indicate the recommended dosage.
- The "ingredients" array should contain objects representing the ingredients and their amounts in the supplement.
